            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

This is the reaſon of the courſe held here, in inquiring what was done or arguing what is to be done for the Publick Service of God. It is not to be expected that the particulars here obſerved or diſcourſed under the judgement of this Church, and the Learned in it, ſhould indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently take place: It is enough if the main foundation, which I have given my thoughts a little freedome to dig for, prove not fleeting. Then may it
<pb facs="tcp:169390:3"/> ſerve for the edifying of it unto peace. However, you ſee wherefore writing in Engliſh, nevertheleſſe I produce the paſſages of Writers in their own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall words. You ſhall find them tranſlated for the ſatisfaction of all ſorts. The learned Readers may pleaſe to excuſe me, if walking for the moſt part an untrodden path, they find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but work cut out, to be made up at leiſure. All may pleaſe to do ſo much right to themſelves or me, as to referre themſelves to ſuch things as the delay of the Preſſe hath given occaſion to adde at the end, before they begin to reade. The Heads of matters here intreated, are premiſed for the eaſe of ſuch as make choice of what they think beſt to reade.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He moſt eminent work that men are able to tender to the honour of God, is his publick Service at the Aſſemblies of Chriſtians. That ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall tincture which the faith of Chriſt and his Grace infuſeth into the beſt of our actions, ſeemeth to conſiſt in the obedience to God, out of which they are done; and the intention of his glory and worſhip, to which they are addreſſed: That the reaſon of them is derived from the will and pleaſure of God, and the intent of them directed to his honour and ſervice. Whereas all the men of this world can do nothing but out of love to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:169390:6"/> themſelves, taking the riſe and motive of their doings from that which concerneth their particulars, and aiming at nothing elſe in their intentions. All ſorts of Chriſtian mens actions, as they proceed from ſuch conſiderations as theſe, are capable to be qualified <hi>the Service of God.</hi> But that which is called his <hi>Publick Service</hi> profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the exerciſe of nothing elſe, neither is capable to be accounted otherwiſe, unleſſe it be counterfeit. For what conſideration can common ſenſe faſten upon that which we do, when we aſſemble our ſelves for religious Service, but the conſcience of our ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God, the acknowledgement of our want of his direction and aſſiſtance, and our deſire and affection to the good which we expect at his hands? Onely to be <hi>Publick</hi> is ſtill an addition of advantage to it, in as much as the honour, which it pleaſeth God to accept at mens hands, becometh his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe more when it proceedeth from more agreement of minds. And as the ſtrength of mens bodies, joyned to one purpoſe, remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth that which one by one they could not do; ſo united devotions prevail with God to ſuch effect, as ſeverally they cannot bring to paſſe. The Prophet Eſay ii. 2, 3, 4. from the Prophet Micah iv. 1. <hi>In the laſt dayes it ſhall come to paſſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that the mountain of the houſe of the Lord ſhall be eſtabliſhed in the</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:169390:6"/> 
                  <hi>top of the mountains, and it ſhall be exalted above the hills: And people ſhall flow unto it, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny nations ſhall come and ſay, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the houſe of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his wayes, and we will walk in his paths: For the law ſhall go forth of Sion, and the word of the Lord from Jeruſalem.</hi> And a third Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, Sophon. iii. 9. <hi>For then will I turn to the people a pure language,</hi> or a pure lip, <hi>that they may call upon the name of the Lord with one conſent,</hi> or with one ſhoulder. The meaning of theſe Prophets is, to tell us what the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſhould do when they applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Church, the mountain of God, the hill of Sion, by two principall particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: They ſhould flow like the waters of a deluge to learn the will of God which the Church teacheth; they ſhould crowd in like a multitude, with one ſhoulder, to ſerve God with that language which he had ſanctified. Who can reade this, and not think what God recommendeth to Chriſtians? one current to the Church, to learn his will there: one ſhoulder, ſtriving who ſhall crowd in firſt: one lip, one language that ſoundeth nothing but his praiſes. So that in the Publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God are fulfilled the words of the Goſpel, Matt. vi. 13. <hi>A city cannot be hid that ſtandeth upon an hill:</hi> Be the Profeſſion what it will be that differenceth a true viſible
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:169390:7"/> Church from a falſe, it muſt be the Publick Service of God that muſt make that Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion viſible. And the Apoſtle, 1. Tim. ii. 8. <hi>I will therefore that men pray every where, lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up pure hands without wrath or diſputing,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>every where,</hi> taketh away the difference which the Temple at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem made; when he ſaith, <hi>without wrath or diſputing,</hi> ſignifieth that his ſpeech is of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Aſſemblies, the fruit whereof he would not have intercepted through their diſſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and ſo expoundeth that <hi>one lip</hi> of the Prophet, ſignifying that unity of mind which Gods people ſerve him with. This is too much to be ſaid here, but perhaps too little to perſwade, how much the frame of Publick worſhip concerneth the honour of God and his Service: How much it muſt needs be for the advantage of godlineſſe, that it be form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without prejudice. Were all particulars of it ordered in Scripture, as the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of that Figurative Service under Moſes are, there were no more to do, but to make all things according to the pattern ſhewed in the mountain, <hi>Hebr.</hi> viii. 5. <hi>Exod.</hi> xxv. 40. And he that did it ſhould be, for his part, faithfull in all the houſe of God, as was Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>Hebr.</hi> iii. 2. <hi>Numb.</hi> xii. 7. But he that is there ſaid to be faithfull in all the houſe of God as Moſes was, hath diſcharged his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in revealing and eſtabliſhing the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:169390:7"/> of the worſhip of God in Spirit and Truth: And what is further determined in Scripture, and what is not, my purpoſe is not to diſpute here, becauſe my diſcourſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from that which I can find expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Scripture, to that which remaineth queſtionable, according to it. For my part, I do not find ſo much delivered concerning the Service of God at the Aſſemblies of Chriſtians, any where in Scripture, as in the firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians, where the Apoſtle diſcourſeth the uſe of Spirituall Graces of that time in thoſe Aſſemblies. And therefore my firſt travell in this little work ſhall be, to inquire the true meaning of that whole diſcourſe of the Apoſtle, the proceeding of it, and the grounds whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his rules are framed. Which to do with ſucceſſe, I ſhall firſt diſcover the office of Prophets and Scribes under the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Temple; of the Graces of Propheſying and of Languages under the firſt times of the Goſpel; in miniſtring the Morall and Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, not the Ceremoniall and Figurative Service of God, at their Aſſemblies for that purpoſe. To the reſult of which inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, if we ſhall joyn the rules which the ſame Apoſtle debateth in the eleventh Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter of the ſame Epiſtle, concerning men and women vailing or uncovering their heads in thoſe Aſſemblies, and concerning
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:169390:8"/> celebrating the Euchariſt, with the Feaſts of Love uſed then at common meetings, with the grounds whereupon they proceed; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to both ſuch paſſages of Scripture as fall in with the meaning of theſe, ſpeaking home to what was done, or preſcribed to be done, at their religious Aſſemblies: perhaps by this means we ſhall be furniſhed of ſuch principles, and ſuch rules derived thence, as the Scriptures afford the Church to proceed upon, as well in the ſubſtance of that which is to be done in the Publick Service of God, as in the form, and courſe, and circumſtances of it. And this, upon the by, will miniſter juſt occaſion to inquire further into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of thoſe Graces and Miniſteries, by which the ſeverall parts of this work were exerciſed at that time according to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, or intended to be exerciſed in after ages. To which point having ſaid ſomething of late in a little tract of the <hi>Primitive govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Churches,</hi> and finding it too much ſlighted there, becauſe the particular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of it ſuted not with the modell of that Treatiſe, my deſire is to take it in hand upon this occaſion once more, and inquire what further ſatisfaction, the conſideration of Publick Service at their religious Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, will yield them that deſire the truth, as concerning the nature and condition of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries firſt inſtituted for that purpoſe.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>OF the Figurative Service proper to the Law of Moſes, and that people which received it, of the kinds, and times, and place for offering ſacrifices, there is particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment in it: but of ſerving God by Prayer, or hearing his Word, you have there ſo much the leſſe remembrance. In <hi>Leviticus</hi> xxiii. we find the particular of all their Solemnities that are called <hi>holy Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies:</hi> For thus the generall is propounded, verſ. 2. <hi>The Aſſemblies of the Lord, which ye ſhall proclaim for holy Convocations, theſe are my Aſſemblies.</hi> The firſt of theſe is the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, then the Paſſeover, Pentecoſt, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the New year, the day of Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Feaſt of Tabernacles. And,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:169390:9"/> with leave, I rather uſe the word <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> then <hi>Feaſts</hi> in this place, becauſe the name of Feaſts is proper to thoſe Solemnities which are to be celebrated with joy and chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: whereas in this number, the day of Atonement was to be obſerved with the greateſt humiliation that could be expreſſed. The Originall word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> conteining all Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, ſuch as all theſe are commanded to be, and as I take it none elſe. For that which is read Pſal. lxxxi. 3. <hi>Blow up the Trumpet in the new Moon, in the time appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, againſt the day of our Feaſts,</hi> dependeth upon the Law, Numb. x. 10. <hi>Alſo in the day of your gladneſſe, and in your ſolemn Feaſt dayes,</hi> (or rather dayes of Aſſemblies, for the word is the ſame that I tranſlated ſo afore) <hi>and in the beginning of your Moneths, you ſhall blow with your Trumpets over the burnt-offerings, and over the ſacrifice of your peace-offerings, that they may be to you for a memoriall before your God.</hi> Where we ſee three ſorts of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities diſtinguiſhed: Firſt, <hi>the day of your gladneſſe,</hi> conteining Solemnities to be celebrated with chearfulneſſe of heart, that is, Feaſts: Then, <hi>the ſolemn dayes of Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,</hi> as the word ſignifieth, conteining be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe, Aſſemblies for humiliation, as the day of Atonement: And laſt, <hi>the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of your Moneths,</hi> wherein peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar ſacrifices are injoyned, <hi>Numb.</hi> xxviii. 11.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:169390:9"/> And here it is provided, that Trumpets ſhould be ſounded over thoſe ſacrifices by the Prieſts in the Tabernacle; but that no Aſſembly is appointed to be upon them, the difference here made between them and their dayes of Aſſemblies, is preſumption enough. But in particular, the firſt and laſt dayes of the Paſſeover, and Feaſt of Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles (the one whereof was kept for ſeven dayes, the other for eight) were to be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Aſſemblies, which the reſt were not, and therefore in the Greek of the Septuagint are called <gap reason="foreign">

Now the Sabbath was the greateſt of all Solemnities appointed for Aſſemblies: For they were commanded ſo to reſt from bodily labour, as not to kindle fire, to dreſſe the meat they eat upon it: For as in <hi>Exod.</hi> xvi. 5, 16, 29. God conteſteth that he gave them a double meaſure of Manna the day before, that they might dreſſe it againſt the Sabbath: So we

                  <hi>Of none of the ſolemn Aſſemblies, beſide the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath and day of Atonement, it is ſaid,</hi> NOMAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NER

Here is a ſtrict command of bodily reſt, eſpecially upon the Sabbath, and that particularized, to concern both Iſraelites themſelves, and their ſlaves, and thoſe that ſojourn within their gates: But that is very conſiderable which excellent Divines have obſerved, That in the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where is ſo large proviſion for bodily reſt, there the purpoſe of that reſt is onely pointed at in generall terms, when it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be SANCTIFIED; which is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe done in all their Solemnities, when they are called ASSEMBLIES: but there is no mention made of any particular work of the Morall Service of God, wherewith the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath is commanded to be ſanctified, or for performance whereof they are commanded to Aſſemble, unleſſe it be the reading of the Law upon the ſeventh yeare, commanded <hi>Deut.</hi> xxxi. 12. So that it ſeemeth the Jews have reaſon, when they obſerve, that neither the Form, nor Time of Prayer, is appointed them by the Law of Moſes, but by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of their Elders, Maimoni of Prayer, <hi>C.</hi> 1. <hi>Numb.</hi> 1, 2. Indeed, that the ſpirituall Service of God, of Prayers, and his Praiſes, of hearing the Word, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating upon his works, was the thing, for
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:169390:11"/> love whereof the Jews were commanded to keep the Sabbath, thoſe miſerable people, who in moſt things are blinded with the letter, and never look under the vail upon Moſes his face, have been able alwayes to perceive; as it is to be ſeen by the ſayings of their late and ancient Writers.

Behold this is alſo a day of Sabbath, which the Jews at this preſent keep with a kind of bodily, languiſhing, diſſolute, and luxurious eaſe: For they are at leiſure for toyes. And whereas God commandeth to keep the Sabbath, they ſpend the Sabbath in that which God forbiddeth. Our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at leiſure is from bad works, theirs from good works; for it is better to plough then to danſe. They are at leiſure from doing good, from trifling buſineſſe they are not at leiſure.</hi> He that readeth this and the like that might be produced,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:169390:13"/> hath cauſe to marvel, that the practice of that people ſhould be ſo wide of the profeſſion of their Doctours: but that there is great cauſe to think, whereas bodily reſt is expreſly commanded, the ſpirituall and morall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of it but intimated in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and by the learned collected from thence, and from other Scriptures, by conſequence of diſcourſe, that the people apprehended that more, which was open, as being for their eaſe, neglecting that which was collected, as not ſo pleaſant. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unleſſe we be wilfull in refuſing the Truth, it cannot be denied, that the DISPEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SATION of that time, prevaileth in this, as well as in other particulars. For though no man doubteth that the Ancient people of God were led by the promiſes of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven, and life everlaſting; yet are thoſe promiſes, in the law of Moſes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed and recommended to them, under the Figure of Paradiſe, of the land of Promiſe, and the fruits of it. <hi>Mihi in Evangelio pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittuntur regna coelorum, quae Inſtrumentum vetus omnino non nominat,</hi> ſaith S. Jerome, Epiſt. 129. <hi>To me is the kingdome of heaven promiſed in the Goſpel, which the old Teſtament doth not ſo much as name.</hi> S. Auguſtine cont.

The old Scriptures are full of Teſtimonies of life everlasting, and the reſurrection of the dead, but the name of the</hi> KINGDOME OF HEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VEN <hi>I meet with in no place of it, for it properly belongeth to the</hi> REVEALING <hi>of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.</hi> Again, <hi>Mortem innuit ſecundam, cùm diceret,</hi> ADAM, UBIES? <hi>ſed de ea nihil dixiſſe credendum eſt, propter</hi> DISPENSATIONEM <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi Teſtamenti, ubi mors ſecunda apertiſsimè de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratur: God intimateth the ſecond death,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>when he ſaith,</hi> ADAM VVHERE ART THOU? <hi>but it is to be thought that he expreſſed nothing of it, becauſe of the</hi> DISPENSATION <hi>of the New Teſtament, where the ſecond death is most mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly declared.</hi> Others might be produced to the ſame purpoſe. The reaſon is the ſame in the matter of Sacrifices, for which we know what particular order is taken in the Law of Moſes, and yet are not the Prophets afraid to ſay, that God gave no command for them. Pſalm. xl. 6. <hi>Sacrifice and offering thou didſt not deſire:</hi> Jerem. viii. 21. <hi>I ſpake not to your Fathers, nor commanded them, in the day when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing burnt-offerings and ſacrifices.</hi> And all this according to the tenour of the Law, which commanded a Ceremoniall Service, as the figure of that worſhip which God requireth in Spirit and Truth. Thus ſtandeth the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:169390:14"/> in our preſent buſineſſe: For if the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath be a figure, as the Scripture declareth, and the Jews themſelves acknowledge, then the obſervation of it commanded muſt needs be Figurative. Which is no more then the Apoſtle proveth in the fourth to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, that the Reſt which they obſerved the Sabbath with, was the Figure of that reſt which remaineth to the people of God. Therefore it pleaſed God, in this point alſo to obſerve that diſpenſation of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, which he had ſet on foot in other particulars: taking order at large, that the Sabbath ſhould be celebrated with bodily reſt, but that Service of God in Spirit and Truth, which is proper to the DISPENSATI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON of the New Teſtament, as it is greateſt in eſteem, ſo is it leaſt in appearance of the Commandment, which God gave for the purpoſe. To the ſame purpoſe, as hitherto it hath been obſerved, that the Law hath ſpecified no particular work of the Morall Service of God, with which it commandeth the Sabbath to be SANCTIFIED, or for which it appointeth ASSEMBLIES: So muſt we further obſerve in this place, that it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther provideth for PLACES, wherein it might be exerciſed by the body of that People, nor taketh order by whom it ſhould be Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in ſuch Places, but hath left us to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect by circumſtance and the traces of their
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:169390:15"/> Ancient practice remembred in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, that it was Miniſtred by the Prophets, as Prophets, rather then by the Prieſts and Levites, as Prieſts and Levites, as well in Synagogues as in the Temple, or at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle. The command of Aſſemblies, <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.</hi> xxiii. might well be preſcribed in the law of Moſes, with a particular effect, in reſpect of that time, that the whole Congregation of that people lived together in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Arabia. Then and there it is eaſie to conceive, how they were aſſembled to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate thoſe ſolemnities, that is, at the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, or round about it, which the Jews call <hi>The Camp of Levi.</hi> But when they were ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in the land of Promiſe, we ſee what the Law requireth: Deut. xvi. 16. <hi>Three times in a year ſhall all thy males appear before the Lord thy God, in the place which he ſhall chuſe.</hi> This is the extent of the Law, thrice a year to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort to the Tabernacle, and that none but Males; and therefore the queſtion will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, How the body of that people aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled themſelves through the year (it being a thing manifeſt that the greateſt part could not reſort to the Tabernacle) and thoſe Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Prayer, which afterwards were called <hi>Synagogues,</hi> whereof Philo ſpeaketh in the words alledged, not yet erected through the Countrey, as ſhall appear by the dark traces of the beginning of them, which we ſhall find
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:169390:15"/> by and by in the Scriptures, during the time of Solomons Temple. So that the words of Philo and Joſephus alledged before, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they tell us, That Moſes commanded that people to Aſſemble every ſeventh day, to learn the Law, that it was their cuſtome ſo to do; and that the Chief taught at thoſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, and the reſt learned to live accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that which was taught, muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood with theſe limitations, That it was col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from the letter of the Law of Moſes, and preſerved in the practice of that people, at ſuch times and places as afforded means of Religious Aſſemblies for ſuch purpoſe. In fine, it will appear, that the Law of Moſes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diſpenſation of that time, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be moſt expreſſe in the Figurative Ceremoniall Service, peculiar to that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by the Miniſteries of Prieſts and Levites, ſo particularly appointed in it for that kind of Service. And yet, ſo little proviſion as we find in the Law for the office of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and children of the Prophets, that is, their diſciples, theſe were the men neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe that Miniſtred the Morall Service of God, of Prayers, and the Praiſes of God, and the expoſition of the Law, at their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Aſſemblies. A thing that may ſound ſtrange to them, that find the charge of Teaching the Law, laid upon the Prieſts and Levites from the beginning, in divers paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:169390:16"/> of it. But if we view thoſe paſſages at a near diſtance, it will appear, that they ſpeak not of TEACHING the Law at any Religious Aſſemblies for ſuch purpoſe, but of deciding caſes emergent, or giving Judgement in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ariſing upon it. Deut. xxiiii. 8. <hi>Take heed in the Plague of Leproſie, that thou obſerve dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, and do according to all that the Prieſts the Levites ſhall</hi> TEACH <hi>you: as I commanded them, ſo ſhall ye obſerve to do.</hi> In <hi>Leviticus</hi> there is much provided, concerning the Prieſts proceeding in judging Leproſies, but that the people ſhould ſtand to their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, proviſion is not made. Here is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that in thoſe caſes, they did not reſort to the Prieſts as to Phyſicians, to follow their ſentence ſo farre as their own reſpect ſhould adviſe, but that their ſentence, called here TEACHING, had the force of binding them to ſtand to it. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> xviii. 18.

                  </gap>. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it materiall, though ſome of theſe Scriptures be otherwiſe underſtood. For my purpoſe is not to ſay, that the people was not taught at all by the Prieſts and Levites at Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Aſſemblies, but not as ſuch. It is for divers reaſons to be believed, That the moſt part of Prophets, and diſciples of Prophets, were Prieſts and Levites. They were free from the care of Eſtates and Inheritances: They were the men that came neareſt to God by their Office in his Ceremoniall Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which, an extraordinary degree of the knowledge and fear of God, beſt ſuited with: But it is as certain, that the charge of Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people, belonged as well to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets that were not Prieſts and Levites. <hi>The Scribes and Phariſees ſit in Moſes chair,</hi> ſaith our Lord in the Goſpel; which is very well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in the words of Philo alledged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; for he telleth us, That it was the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, from the time of Moſes, for the Chief to teach, and the people to learn to live as he taught. Then, the Chair of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, is the Chair of Doctrine as well as of Judgement, and Moſes the Chief of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, as well as of Judges. But it is well known what the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, Numb. xi. 16, 17. <hi>Gather unto me ſeventy men</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:169390:18"/> 
                  <hi>of the Elders of Iſrael, whom thou knoweſt to be Elders of the people, and Officers over them, and I will take of the Spirit that is upon thee, and put it upon them.</hi> Theſe that were known to be Elders of Iſrael in their ſeverall Tribes, or their Officers in Egypt, as we reade <hi>Exod.</hi> iiii. 29. v. 19. are choſen to receive their ſhare of Moſes his ſpirit: whereupon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, verſ. 29. <hi>And it came to paſſe that when the ſpirit reſted upon them, they propheſied and ceaſed not.</hi> The Jews Doctours, ſeem to apprehend the nature of the Gift which theſe men received, not amiſſe. Moſes Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moni <hi>in More Nebochim.</hi> ii. 45. Abarbinel upon the place. They tell us, that the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree of Gods ſpirit, was that whereby men found themſelves moved and inabled, to thoſe works of wiſdome and courage, which otherwiſe they thought not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves fit to undertake, with aſſurance that all was from above. This is the Grace, ſay they, which the Judges received, when it is ſaid, THE SPIRIT OF GOD INVESTED GE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEON, OR CAME UPON SAMPSON, for example. The ſecond is, when men are moved to ſpeak of things belonging to the knowledge of God, and his praiſes, beyond their naturall or habituated capacities, without ſeeing any figures, aſleep or awake, but with aſſurance that it was from God. And this they make to be the Grace of them, which writ thoſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:169390:18"/> parts of Scripture, which the Jews call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, <hi>Written by the Holy Ghost,</hi> which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe in a large ſenſe are called <hi>Prophets:</hi> And in theſe two degrees they ſay conſiſted the condition of Saul, that was indued with the Holy Ghoſt, to inable him for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo as ſometimes he arrived at the rank of a Prophet. And thus theſe Elders recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the ſpirit of Moſes, for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the people with him, in ſuch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that they atteined alſo to be Prophets. It is the conſtant Tradition of that people, That the knowledge of the Law, was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by Moſes, and this Conſiſtory of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to ſucceeding ages. Which if it go no further, is no more then reaſon for us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, though they have built all the foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of their unwritten Law upon it. If Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were the Chief of Doctours, thoſe of Moſes his Bench muſt needs in their degree be the like. The Lord promiſeth to his people a ſucceſſour to Moſes in this Grace, Deut. xviii. 15. <hi>A Prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you of your brethren like unto me, him ſhall you heare:</hi> which the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament verifieth in our Lord Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> vii. 37. and elſewhere. But if this promiſe be partly verified for the time, in thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets which God raiſed up from age to age after Moſes, for further knowledge of the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:169390:19"/> Law which he gave, as the promiſe of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, was for the time, in part verified in their Judges and Kings, by whom God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered his people from their enemies, as ſome will have it, then is the charge of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Prophets, but the relative of their charge, in Teaching the people. In the time of Samuel we reade of certain Colledges of Prophets, and diſciples of Prophets, ſuch as was that 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> x. 5. where Saul and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant met a company of Prophets; and ſuch as was that 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> xix. 18, 20. at Naioth in Ramah, where Dauid abode with Samuel: and where Sauls meſſengers ſaw the <hi>company of Prophets propheſying, and Samuel ſtanding as appointed over them.</hi> This Naioth in Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah, is here tranſlated by Jonathan the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee Paraphraſt, <gap reason="foreign">

It is the place where Samuel was born and dwelt, called in the beginning of that book, <hi>Ramathaim Sophim,</hi> in the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and is the ſame with Joſephs Town of <hi>Arimathaea</hi> in the Goſpell. By the word it ſhould ſeem it was compounded of two Towns, in the one whereof was Naioth, the reſidence of thoſe that ſtudied the Law there under Samuell: whereupon Jonathan tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth it there, <hi>Ramah of the diſciples of the Prophets.</hi> It is here very much to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:169390:19"/> that they were forbidden by the Law, <hi>To offer Sacrifice but before the Ark, in the place which the Lord ſhall chuſe.</hi> Nevertheleſſe, while this choice of God ſtood ſuſpended, and while the houſe at Shiloh was deſolate, from the time that the Ark was taken by the Philiſtines, till it was ſettled again at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, High places were licenſed as the Jews ſpeak, that is, it was lawfull to offer Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where the Ark was not. Such are theſe whereof we now ſpeak, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> ix. 12. x. 5. where Jonathan tranſlateth it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <hi>the houſe of Feaſting,</hi> becauſe having offered their peace-offerings, the uſe was, To Feaſt upon the remains of them, as you find it there. In fine, the people aſſembling to ſuch places to offer their Sacrifices, and to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate their Solemnities, and the Prophets having their Reſidence there, what doubt can be made, but that all this muſt be, for the purpoſe of preaching to the people, as they aſſembled there, or miniſtring what elſe may appear to belong to their office? And this is well apprehended by men of learning, to be the beginning of Synagogues and Schools among that people. For when the Ark was ſettled, and it was become unlawfull to offer ſacrifices in the High places, to aſſemble for publick prayers, and the praiſes of God, and learning the Law, was no inconvenience. The like is to be ſaid of thoſe aboads of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,

Onely the doubt is, to what time the meaning of this Pſalm is to be related, and when it might be penned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Junius hath been bold to referre it to Antiochus Epiphanes his time. But the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Tradition of the Jews ſeemeth to have obteined the credit of Hiſtoricall Truth, that the Scripture was ſigned in Ezra's time: And the end of Malachi (whom the Jews will have to be Ezra) ſeemeth to ſpeak no leſſe, iiii. 4. ſounding like the paſſage from the Old to the New Teſtament: reflecting upon the Old, when he biddeth them <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Law of Moſes,</hi> and pointing at the New, when he promiſeth the <hi>ſending of Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as before the day of the Lord came.</hi> Beſides, it is againſt the Truth of Hiſtory, that the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was deſtroyed in Antiochus Epiphanes his time, which not onely this Pſalm, but divers of the ſame Title import. lxxix. 1. <hi>O God the Heathen are come into thine inheritance, thine holy Temple have they defiled, and made Jeruſalem an heap of ſtones.</hi> Upon the Title of this Pſalm, which is, <hi>A Pſalm of Aſaph,</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:169390:21"/> the Chaldee deſcanteth thus: <hi>A ſong, by the hands of Aſaph, upon the deſolation of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, by the ſpirit of Propheſie he ſaid,</hi> lxxxi. 13. <hi>The Boar out of the wood doth waſt it, and the Wild Beaſt of the field doth devoure it.</hi> Therefore I obſerve much, what we reade af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the lxxii. Pſalm; <hi>Here end the prayers of David the ſonne of Jeſſe:</hi> and yet you ſhall find not a few under Davids name after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Which ſeemeth to argue the firſt to have been a ſeverall Collection of Davids Pſalms by themſelves: Beſides which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe were found others of his, which with the reſt, belonging to other names, as Moſes, Aſaph, Heman, and others, make up the Collection that followeth. The Caſe is not much unlike in the book of Proverbs. Two Titles of <hi>Solomons Proverbs, C.</hi> i. &amp; x. argue two ſeverall Collections. <hi>C.</hi> xxv. there beginneth a third Collection of them with this Title, <hi>Theſe are alſo Proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah King of Judah co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied out.</hi> But that this Collection laſteth to the end of the book, meeting with a Title ſo diſputable, <hi>C.</hi> xxx. who ſhall aſſure us? Since then after the lxxii. Pſalm, where we reade, <hi>Here end the prayers of David ſonne of Jeſſe,</hi> there follow a conſiderable number under the name of Aſaph, why ſhould we doubt him to be writer of them, more then David of his? Or that he, that was a Prophet, as
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:169390:21"/> ſhall be ſaid, foreſaw in them the deſtruction of Jeruſalem by Nebuchadnezzar and the Chaldeans? If there can yet be queſtion who penned the Pſalm, it is quite extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Text of 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> xxix. 30. where Ezekiah commandeth the Levites to praiſe God <hi>in the words of David and Aſaph:</hi> And therefore the Scripture ſpeaketh of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues during Solomons Temple: But with ſuch obſcure remembrance, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be thought, they could afford the body of that people means to aſſemble for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God. One doubt there is yet behind, as concerning this <hi>Grace:</hi> to what purpoſe the diſciples of the Prophets ſtudied for that Grace, which was onely in the power of the Holy Ghoſt to beſtow, being farre from us to believe, as ſome Mahumetane Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers are ſaid to do, That it is to be compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with humane indevours: which if they aimed not towards that purpoſe, why then are they called <hi>ſonnes,</hi> that is Diſciples, <hi>of the Prophets,</hi> as the Chaldee of Jonathan alwayes tranſlateth it? Why do we ſee, that for the moſt part, in Scripture, thoſe perſons that were brought up to it, were indued with the Grace? It was in the power of God, no doubt, to beſtow it where he pleaſed: never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, ſo it was found, that for the moſt part he did beſtow it, where mens manners were ſuitable, where mens courſes were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:169390:22"/> to it: (To ſay nothing here of thoſe diſpoſitions of nature and fortune which the Ebrew Doctours require) this is to be ſeen in the place alledged 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> x. 11. And the Proverb that did riſe upon Sauls propheſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Is Saul alſo among the Prophets?</hi> For had it not been unuſuall, that perſons never bred to any ſuch courſe, ſhould be inveſted with the Spirit on the ſudden, it had not been ſo great a marvell, as to cauſe and occaſion the Proverb: On the other ſide, to ſhew how it cometh to paſſe, it followeth there, <hi>And one of the ſame place anſwered and ſaid, But who is their father?</hi> To ſay, that ſeeing theſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Prophets, that is, Diſciples, had God to their Father, to teach them by his Spirit, it was no marvell to ſee a man grown a Prophet without help of other Maſters. Which is the caſe that Amos expreſſeth vii. 14. <hi>I was no Prophet, nor Prophets ſonne, but an heardſman, and gatherer of Sycomore fruit, And the Lord took me, as I followed the flock, and the Lord ſaid unto me, Go, Propheſie unto my people Iſrael.</hi> Now, the ſtudy that diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed men to this Grace, was, without doubt, that of the Law of Moſes: in that all conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ſpent their time, that pretended, though ſome atteined the Gift of Gods Grace, others ſtayed at that knowledge, which by humane indevours they could compaſſe: Whereupon that which is called

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:169390:27"/> with, are not diſtinguiſhed in the Subſtance of that Language: So it is moſt certain, that the way of reading, was not at the firſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to that people, in that method of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Rules, which ſince hath been invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but was taught and received by particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Tradition, and continued by remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance and practice. Whereupon it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, what difference of ſounds may be faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon the ſame characters of letters, if it be but from that moſt ancient Tranſlation of the Bible in Greek, commonly aſcribed to ſeventy Elders of Iſrael. The ſubſtance whereof ſtill remaining (whatſoever altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may have been made) is ſufficient to ſhew, how much difference there was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the reading which they followed, and that which we now uſe. And by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, how much it concerned the true meaning of the Law, to have learned the true reading of it, which the Jews, whoſe reading we follow, pretend to have received from Eſdras, and the men of learning in his time, whom they call <hi>the men of the Grand Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue.</hi> But the endleſſe niceties and curious obſervances, wherewith the reading, which we now deſervedly uſe, is delivered unto us, is ſufficient to demonſtrate that which I was ſaying afore, that from the beginning, the certain manner of reading was delivered by particular obſervance, and in time became
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:169390:27"/> reduced unto that generall method, which now we uſe, with ſuch unſpeakable ſpeed and advantage. Thus, all that made profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of book-learning among that people, are called <hi>Scribes;</hi> though it ſeemeth, ſome that injoyed the ſtyle, went no further then wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and reading. And ſuch as theſe they were, that taught little children afterwards among the Jews, of whoſe Office we find Rules in Maimoni, <hi>Talmud Torah. cap.</hi> 11. And the Jewiſh Doctours imagine, that Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob propheſied, that moſt of theſe ſhould be of the Tribe of Simeon, when he ſaid, Gen. xlix. 7. <hi>I will divide them in Jacob and ſcatter them in Iſrael.</hi> And the Commentaries under S. Ambroſe his name, expound the Office of thoſe Doctours, of whom S. Paul ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 28. in theſe words, <hi>Illos dicit Doctores, qui in Eccleſia literis &amp; lectionibus retinendis pueros imbuebant, more Synagogae, quia traditio illorum ad nes tranſitum fecit: He ſpeaketh of thoſe Teachers in the Church, which inſtructed children in reading and reteining their leſſons, after the faſhion of the Synagogue, for their Tradition hath paſſedover to us.</hi> How well he hath deciphered the Office of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours in the Apoſtle, we ſhall ſee after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; but that which he ſaith, of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of teaching children to reade, and ſay over leſſons of the Scripture, which the Church learned from the Synagogue, is that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:169390:28"/> buſineſſe of leſſe learned Scribes, whereof we ſpeak. For there was a further degree of knowledge, conſiſting in the expoſition of the Law, which is the third particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, expreſſed in Abarbinels words, in the ſecond place, and thoſe which came to this pitch, as they were ſtill Scribes, which is the name common to all men of learning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong that people, ſo they were counted WISEMEN beſides, in regard of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Law they profeſſed, which was the wiſdome of that people, according to <hi>Deut.</hi> iiii. 6. Thus you ſhall find Scribes and Wiſemen joyned together in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament: Matth. xxiii. 34. <hi>Behold I ſend unto you Prophets, and Wiſemen, and Scribes:</hi> And 1. Cor. i. 20. <hi>Where is the Wiſe? Where is the Scribe? Where is the diſputer of this world?</hi> And for this cauſe it is, that the Diſciples of the Prophets are tranſlated <hi>Scribes</hi> in Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, as was ſaid afore: And the ſame are the WISEMEN which taught the Law of God in the Temple: which we alſo reade of Ezra the Scribe, vii. 10. <hi>For Ezra had prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his heart to ſeek the Law of the Lord, and to do, and to teach in Iſrael Statutes and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> Whether they were Prieſts, and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, or whether they were others, that were bred from their youth to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Law and Scriptures, theſe were the men, and no other but theſe, that were
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:169390:28"/> indifferently aſſumed to ſit in all Courts of Judgement of that people, and to teach in their Schools and Synagogues. You heard afore ſome ſlight remembrance of places of learning, where Companies of Prophets had their reſidence, ſome ſuſpicion of Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, where that people aſſembled, not for that Ceremoniall worſhip which was confined to the Temple, but for the Morall and Spirituall Service of God, according to the light of that time, during the time of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons Temple. But after the return from Babylon, Schools and Synagogues, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, were multiplied all over the Countrey; and the effect of it was, without doubt, of unſpeakable benefit. Men of learning have thought it ſtrange, and inquired what the reaſon might be, that this people, before their Captivity, when they had the Prophets to teach and admoniſh them, ſtill from time to time ſhould fall away from God to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Idoles: whereas after their return, though there were no more Prophets, nor miracles wrought, nevertheleſſe they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued conſtant in the Service of one God, however the ſervice and knowledge of him were corrupted. To my underſtanding this one reaſon goeth farre in giving account of it; becauſe where Aſſemblies were held, where the Law was read and taught, where the Service of God was exerciſed, that is,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:169390:29"/> where there were Synagogues, there was the moſt powerfull means to hold them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to that which they profeſſed. But on the other ſide, we ſee what a great evil ſprung among them in ſtead of it, diverſities of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, ſects and diviſions, among them which held all conſtant to one Law, whereof the Learned profeſſed the Knowledge. The chief whereof were thoſe of the Sadduces and Phariſees which the Goſpel remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth; and which are remembred here, to ſhew, that they took not upon them the Teaching of the Law, but as they were Scribes, as well as Phariſees or Sadduces: the name of <hi>Scribes</hi> importing the learning of the Law to which they were bred, the name of <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Sadduces,</hi> the ſect and manner of life they profeſſed, according to the opinions thoſe orders maintained. So that as nothing hindereth him that hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed ſome Monaſticall Order, to proceed in the Degrees of the Schools, no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience is it, to take the ſame men, both for Scribes, and alſo for Phariſees and Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces. <hi>The Scribes and Phariſees ſit in Moſes Chair,</hi> ſaith our Lord, <hi>Matth.</hi> xxiii. 2. the difference is made, becauſe many were Scribes that were not Phariſees, as alſo many Phariſees that were no Scribes: as in thoſe words which Sigonius hath produced out of the life of James ſonne of Zebedee, <hi>Joſias</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:169390:29"/> 
                  <hi>unus è</hi> SCRIBIS PHARIS AEORUM, <hi>miſit fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem in collum Apoſtoli: Joſias a</hi> SCRIBE, ONE OF THE PHARISEES, <hi>put a rope upon the Apoſtles neck.</hi> Gamaliel, of whom we reade in the Scripture for S. Pauls Maſter, is called there a <hi>Phariſee;</hi> and that he was a Scribe for his learning, there can be no doubt. And when it is ſaid, Acts xxiii. 9. <hi>The Scribes that were of the Phariſees part,</hi> it is plain that there were alſo Scribes of the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces: which ſeem to have carried more credit after our Lords death, under another High Prieſt, then when he was alive. For when it is ſaid, Acts v. 17. <hi>Then the High Prieſt roſe up, and all that were with him, which is the ſect of the Sadduces, and were filled with indignation,</hi> it may be obſerved that afore, iiii. 2. we reade thus, <hi>And as they ſpake unto the people, the Priests and Captain of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the Sadduces came upon them,</hi> which ſame faction is thus ſpecified verſ. 5. <hi>And it came to paſſe on the morrow that their Rulers and Elders, and Scribes were gathered together at Jeruſalem;</hi> out of which as it is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed that the faction of the Sadduces, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by the High Prieſt, had then the ſtroke, (whereupon the Apoſtles preaching then the Reſurrection of our Lord, found ſome advantage in Gamaliel, and S. Paul after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the Phariſees) ſo there is neceſſity to think, the ſame were Scribes and Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:169390:30"/> both, which dealt in theſe matters. And for the third ſect of the Eſſenes, there is no doubt, but the learned of them alſo were counted in the number of the Scribes; ſeeing we know that they taught the Law in their own Synagogues, as ſhall be ſaid. But of thoſe that are called in the Goſpel <hi>Lawyers,</hi> there is queſtion among men of learning, what might be the difference between them and Scribes, whoſe Profeſſion was the Law of Moſes, and the Expoſition of it. For when our Lord ſaith unto them, Luke xi. 46. <hi>Wo unto you alſo Lawyers,</hi> having ſaid the like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the Scribes, it is plain, that he might ſpeak to Scribes and not to Lawyers, and yet the Profeſſion of Scribes being the Law of Moſes, and the Expoſition of it, it is ſtrange there ſhould be Lawyers which were no Scribes. And therefore my reſolution muſt be, that they ceaſe not to be Scribes which are called Lawyers, but as they own that ſtyle for their Profeſſion of Learning, ſo is the other due for the Priviledge they have in it: which ſeemeth to have been among them, whatſoever was then conferred by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands, which made them Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies or Doctours of the Law that had it: Maimoni, <hi>in Sanedrin.

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:169390:30"/> ſhall obſerve the words that he uſeth, Luke xx. 45. <hi>Then anſwered one of the</hi> LAVVYERS <hi>and ſaid unto him, Maſter, in thus ſaying thou reprocheſt us alſo:</hi> to ſhew, that they were ſtill of a better rank then the reſt, and ſhould take it worſe to be found fault with; which is here verified, by the Priviledge which they of all other Scribes were inveſted with. For to ſhew in how great eſteem was this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion among that people, be it here obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that no man was capable, at leaſt of ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in their Courts of Judgement, but thoſe that were bred to this kind of knowledge. I ſpeak not here of the free times of that Common-wealth, under their own Laws and Governours: Then, it is reaſon to think, that the Princes of Iſrael, and nobleſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, were placed in the Grand Court of lxxi. at Jeruſalem, with the Chief Prieſts, and Prophets, or their Succeſſours, the greateſt of the Scribes to aſſiſt them in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Law. It is obſerved of late, that Joſephus maketh the middle Court of xxiii. to conſiſt but of vii. with two aſſiſtants to each of them, of the tribe of Levi, to wit, for the knowledge of the Law; which came near the number of xxiii. The deſcription that followeth derived from their Ancient Doctours, ſeemeth to concern the times when the freedome of the people was aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that great Court reduced, from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:169390:31"/> the State, to judge the greateſt of thoſe matters wherein they were left to their own Laws. Which fitteth the preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe nevertheleſſe. Becauſe from it we ſhall perceive the imployment of their Scribes, together with the faſhion of their Conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and of their Synagogues in conſequence, whereupon that which is to follow depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. R. Moſes in Sanedrin. C. ii. num. 1. <hi>They place not in any Sanedrin, great or little, but</hi> WISEMEN; <hi>men abounding in knowledge of the Law, men of large knowledge in other Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences:</hi> And ſtraight afterwards, <hi>They place not in the Sanedrin but Prieſts and Levites, and Iſraelites of birth, ſit to be of Alliance to the Prieſthood, as it is ſaid, Numb.</hi> xi. 16. AND THEY SHALL STAND THERE VVITH THEE: <hi>of men like thee, in wiſdome, and godlineſſe, and birth. And it is a precept, that there be Prieſts and Levites of the Great Sanedrin, as it is ſaid, Deut.</hi> xvii. 9. AND THOU SHALT COME UN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TO THE PRIESTS THE LEVITES. <hi>But if none be found, though there be none but Iſraelites, it is allowable.</hi> Iſraelites of birth, were not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed for their birth: for the Prieſts and Levites, that were counted among them of beſt birth, ſate not there, unleſſe their learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were anſwerable: The High Prieſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, unleſſe he were fit for his wiſdome, had no place in the Sanedrin of Seventy one in Jeruſalem, as it followeth ſtraight after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:169390:31"/> Now the manner of breeding here requiſite is to be underſtood, from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the ſecond Court, of three and twenty, which he maketh in the firſt Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter there afore. Num. 6. <gap reason="foreign">

But the loweſt of their Courts was thus: Cap. 1. num. 6. <hi>In Cities of leſſe then ſixſcore Families, they place</hi> THREE <hi>Judges, as in no Court leſſe then three, that it may have more and leſſe if they chance to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in a Cauſe.

                  <hi>one to ſpeak, it is a Sanedrin: where there are three, it is mean: where foure, whereof three can ſpeak, that is a Sanedrin of Wiſdome:</hi> For as you have it there afterwards, C. ii. num. ult. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Though a Court of three be a full Court, it is commendable whenſoever there are more, and better that a Cauſe be decided by eleven then by ten; and it is requiſite that all that ſit in the Court be Diſciples of the</hi> WISE, <hi>and fitting.</hi> So, though this Court, reaching but to money matters, require not Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hands, yet you ſee what qualities it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, in two that are neceſſary, and in all that may ſit in it. And thus it appeareth how that is verified in particular, which was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally affirmed afore, That none could come to ſit in any of their Courts of Juſtice, but their Scribes, but their Wiſe, but the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Wiſe, but thoſe that were bred to the knowledge of the Law. But it concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth my purpoſe to obſerve further, in that deſcription of the middle Court, the three ranks of Diſciples that ſate beneath the Judges by degrees, according to their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, becauſe the like order took place at their religious Aſſemblies in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, the people ſitting flat on the floores.

For which purpoſe you have ſeen hitherto that the Doctours ſate with their faces to the people, that they might be ready to ſtand up when the Law was read, and from thence take the Occaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Argument of their ſpeech to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, Acts xv. 21. <hi>For Moſes hath of Old time in every City them that preach him; being read in the Synagogues e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Sabbath.</hi> And Acts xiii. 14. <hi>Paul and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas went into the Synagogue at Antiochia in Piſidia on the Sabbath, and ſate down: And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the Rulers of the Synagogue ſent unto them, ſaying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to the people, ſay on.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:169390:36"/> place, in this faſhion of ſitting, was moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, among that people, by that of King Saul, 1. Sam. xx. 25. <hi>And the King ſate upon his ſeat as at other times, even upon a ſeat by the wall.</hi> Sol. Jarchi, <gap reason="foreign">

And thereupon, by the way, we have cauſe to think, that there is no miſtake, in the vulgar way of repreſenting the laſt Supper of our Lord; which the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Jeſuite Sirmondus, <hi>Annot. in Sidon.</hi> 1. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt.</hi> ii. thinketh the Painters make, when they ſet our Lord in the midſt at Table. Whereas the right order he conceiveth to be that, which he obſerved in the Moſaicall work at Capua, done by the Abbot of Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſino, that was afterward Victor II. Pope, where our Lord ſitteth in the dexter point of the Couch, S. John leaning his head in his boſome, who by that means, might eaſily perceive S. Peter becken to him, as he ſate in the ſiniſter point of it, as chief of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples. And indeed he hath reaſon to ſay, that among the Romanes, the dexter point was moſt honourable, the ſiniſter next to it: but among the Ebrews, as hath been ſaid, it was the middle, where S. John leaning in
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:169390:36"/> our Lords boſome, might eaſily enough per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive S. Peter becken as he ſate in the point. But in the words alledged out of Maimoni, we muſt now obſerve the condition of theſe Elders of the Synagogue which he ſaith ſate in the head of the Aſſembly with their faces to the people. It is the Title of thoſe chief of the Tribes, that had authority over the people in Egypt, out of whom were choſen the ſeventy Aſſiſtants to Moſes in the Grand Conſiſtory, as was ſaid. It is in the Goſpel the Title of thoſe, in whom, together with the chief Prieſts and Scribes, the authority over that people reſted, ſo farre as they were ſuffered to uſe their own Laws, the Grand Court of Seventy, being at that time either diſſolved, or removed from Jeruſalem, and abated, as the Talmudiſts, agreeing with Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus, relate: for he telleth us, that they were put to death by Herod, <hi>Antiq.</hi> xv. ii. They tell us, that they removed from Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem xl. years before the deſtruction of the Temple, that is, a little before our Lords death, becauſe they would not be uſed as a ſtale to give ſentence of death, beſide their own Judgement; the force of their ſentence conſiſting in their reſidence at Jeruſalem, as they will have it: <hi>Aboda zara, c.</hi> i. which it is probable is to be underſtood, when they began to recover themſelves, of the blow received under Herod. Correſpondently
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:169390:37"/> therefore, in the Synagogues of their diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, under this name we muſt underſtand thoſe, by whoſe Authority the common bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes of the Congregation were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, ſo farre as they had leave to uſe their own Law among the Nations; which it ſeemeth are therefore called, Acts xiii. 15. <hi>Rulers of the Synagogue,</hi> and were ſometimes men of Learning, Scribes, Wiſemen, Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies, otherwhiles not. That their Doctours in this reſpect were called <hi>Elders,</hi> I will uſe no other proof but that which is ordered in their Law concerning him that they call a <hi>Rebellious Elder,</hi> of whom Maimoni in Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim, cap. vii. n. 1. <hi>A Rebellious Elder is not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to death, till he be a</hi> WISEMAN <hi>that hath attained to be fit to decide, next to a Sanedrin.</hi> And in Talmud Torah, <hi>cap.</hi> vii. 1. a Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that is, an Elder excellent in wiſdome, is one of thoſe that muſt not be excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in publick. On the other ſide, that ſome of theſe Elders in Synagogues were not Rabbies, it ſhall appear, by the deſcription which the ſame Rabbi maketh, of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in holding the Faſt of Seven dayes, whereof he writeth in Taanioth, Cap. iiii. 2. <gap reason="foreign">

Theſe are the Elders of the Synagogues remembred of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanius, <hi>Haer.</hi> xxx. <hi>n.</hi> 11. and in divers Conſtitutions of the Emperours, mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all publick Perſons in Synagogues.

For the Jews are no flinchers from old cuſtomes. We are to obſerve further here, what Elders were made by Impoſition of hands.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>And how is Impoſition of hands done? Not that they ſtay their hands upon the head of the Elder, but that they call him</hi> RABBI, <hi>and ſay to him, Behold, thou art Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, and haſt licence to judge even Finable Cauſes. And they give not this Impoſition of hands, which is the Ordination of Elders to be Judges, but by three.</hi> So that of the Miſna Sanedrin, C. i. n. 2. <hi>Ordination of Elders is done by three;</hi> may well be underſtood of ſuch Elders as are Ordained Judges in Finable Cauſes, becauſe the name of <hi>Elders</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to Judges &amp; other Elders. True it is, there be other purpoſes reckoned by Maimoni (in the place aforeſaid) afterwards, to which they might be Ordained. But all of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern controverſies of the Law, which their Ordination licenceth them to decide. And
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:169390:38"/> ſeeing it is ſaid, That Ordination is made by ſtyling the Perſon Ordained, <hi>Rabbi,</hi> it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it belonged to none but DOCTOURS. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in the Itinerary aforeſaid, we reade, that in his dayes, about the year of our Lord MCLXXIII. all the Rabbies and Deacons of Synagogues of that great Reſort, were appointed by him, whom they called <hi>Head of the Exile,</hi> at Bagdat, and came thither to him to get Impoſition of hands, <hi>p.</hi> 73. <hi>&amp;</hi> 74. But according to the ancient cuſtome of that People, thoſe that were promoted Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies, by Impoſition of hands, were made onely in the land of Iſrael, that is, in all that they poſſeſſed when they came out of Egypt. <hi>Inſomuch that unleſſe he that Promoted, and he that was Promoted, were both in the land of Promiſe, there was no Impoſition of hands: If both were within the compaſſe of it, then might it be done by writing, if they were not preſent:</hi> Maimoni in the ſame place. Therefore, if we believe, that all Elders of Synagogues and Deacons, (called among them <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </argument>
               <p>WHen the Goſpel of Chriſt was to be publiſhed to the world, the Nation of the Jews was now diſperſed farre and wide, and their Synagogues and Aſſemblies ſettled in the moſt eminent places of the Romane Empire, as the Acts of the Apoſtles alone is enough to inform us. Gods ſingular Providence having procured their Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the writings that contein it, thus to come to the knowledge of the Gentiles, to make way for the Goſpel which drew near. Now the Apoſtles being themſelves Jews by birth, and pretending to call thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations which they converted to the Faith, whether from Jews or Gentiles, to a Condition correſpondent to that of the Jews in their baniſhment, that is, as the Apoſtle alludeth 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 11. to live Strangers and Pilgrimes from that Jeruſalem which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, as they were from Jeruſalem upon earth, it is no marvel if the State of them which they ordained, bear a great deal of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with the Synagogue. The chief point of which correſpondence conſiſteth in thoſe Presbyteries, upon which, as hath been proved elſewhere, they ſtated the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of thoſe Churches, which they
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:169390:40"/> converted to the Faith. It is no marvel that the Apoſtles ordained theſe Presbyteries of Churches with Impoſition of hands, though it be more then I can affirm of thoſe Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of Synagogues. It was from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a ſenſible ſigne of Gods hand ſtretched out to beſtow the Grace of the Holy Ghoſt, which was pretended to be procured by the Benediction of him that gave it. Such Graces of the Holy Ghoſt the Apoſtles profeſſed to go along with the Truth which they preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to convince all nations of it. And we ſee how it pleaſed God to make good what they profeſſed, by that abundance of Spirituall Graces mentioned by the Apoſtle. Whereas the Jews may ſeem to have confined thoſe Graces to the land of Promiſe, out of their opinion of that kingdome which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe themſelves there. In regard of this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands, the Presbyteries of Churches may well be compared with thoſe Conſiſtories of the Jews, which were ſo ordained, as well for deciding matters of Judgement, as for teaching the Law, at ſuch time as thoſe ſame Conſiſtories, were among them, as well Schools of Learning, as Courts of Judicature. Thoſe Conſiſtories, with their Preſidents, whereof you heard afore out of Moſes Maimoni, anſwering theſe Presbyteries, and the Heads of them called <hi>Biſhops,</hi> which came over them, as hath been
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:169390:40"/> ſhewed, in ſucceſſion to the Apoſtles. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, ſetting aſide Impoſition of hands, the very pattern of theſe Presbyteries in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches, is to be ſeen in thoſe Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries of great and populous Synagogues under their Rulers, or Archiſynagogues, whereof hath been ſaid. To make this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence further to appear, that which hath been diſcourſed, of the manner, in which theſe Conſiſtories or Elders ſate in the School or Synagogue, ſhall now be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to have held in the Church, for the ſitting of the Biſhop and his Presbyters.

What ſhall we imagine of him that denieth the very Chairs, wherein the Apoſtles ſate in the Head of thoſe Churches, to be poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by their Succeſſours as was pretended there, from whence Tertullian argueth? For when he ſaith, <hi>that they ſounded their voice and repreſented their viſage,</hi> doth he not affirm that their Epiſtles written to thoſe Churches preached in their abſence, as themſelves did out of thoſe Chairs in preſence? I have ſhewed out of the Scriptures, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles exerciſed the Government in chief, of thoſe Churches which they had planted Presbyteries to govern, as occaſion requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The Chairs whereof Tertullian ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:169390:43"/> were the ſeats of that Government, as well as Doctrine, when they were there. The Apoſtles had divers companions which were both their Diſciples in the Doctrine, and their Coadjutours in the work of the Goſpel. Of theſe S. Paul ſpeaketh, Phil. iv. 3. <hi>With Clement alſo, and the reſt of my work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellows.</hi> Theſe, or ſome of theſe, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times gave perſonall attendance upon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, not moving in their office but at their diſpoſing, became afterwards ſettled by them upon particular Churches, which they found they could not attend ſo well them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for the government of thoſe which were converted, and the converſion of thoſe which were not. Thus were Timotheus and Titus placed over the Churches of Aſia and Crete, juſt upon the time when he made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to ſee them no more. Thus was Mark attendant on Peter at writing his firſt Epiſtle, v. 13. who was afterward, as all agree, ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him at Alexandria, and did the office of an Evangeliſt there. Clemens and Linus, companions of the Apoſtles, All Antiquity agreeth, were placed by them over the Church at Rome, though in what rank and condition, it agreeth not. The words of Theodoret are remarkable, where he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth the queſtion, Why S.

S. Paul ſendeth for Timotheus to Rome, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> iiii. 9. as for Titus to Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis, iii. 12. who was alſo with him at Rome, and went thence to Dalmatia, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> iiii. 10. But did he mean that his inſtructions ſhould be void thenceforth, or be practiced at Epheſus, and in Crete afterwards? We cannot diſcredit Antiquity that maketh them Biſhops there, without offering violence to the tenour of the Scriptures that inforceth it. But how is Titus counted Biſhop of a Church, that is inſtructed to plant Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries through the cities of Crete, i. 3. all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his own government and overſight? or how is Timotheus Biſhop of one Church of Epheſus, that is, inſtructed to govern, as well as to plant all the Presbyteries whereof the Apoſtle writeth? for all thoſe Presbyteries import Epiſcopall Churches. No otherwiſe then the Apoſtle had his Chair in all the Churches of his planting, according to Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian. The Apoſtles could not ſettle all things in the intended form at the beginning. So farre there is no fault in Epiphanius his
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:169390:44"/> words. Not becauſe they knew not what to do, but for reaſons beſt known to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; becauſe perhaps they might find it more to the purpoſe, to put into the hands of their own Diſciples thoſe Churches on which depended the planting and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of many more, then to ſet men untried over the Presbyteries of particular Churches. Is S. Mark Biſhop of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria the leſſe, becauſe he preached the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel through the Countrey under it, becauſe he planted the government of Churches, perhaps under his own overſight for the time? Or what inconvenience is it, that S. James an Apoſtle, ſhould be deputed by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Apoſtles, to exerciſe that office in the parts of Paleſtine and Arabia, alwayes with reſort to his reſidence at the Mother Church of Jeruſalem? or that he ſhould therefore be counted Biſhop of it? In due time, even during the age of the Apoſtles, ſeverall Churches had their ſeverall Biſhops, as appeareth by the Angels of the ſeven Churches of Aſia, which from the beginning were in the compaſſe of Timothies charge. At firſt all Presbyters were Angels of Churches, according to the Apoſtle, 1. Cor. xi. <hi>For this cauſe ought a woman to have power upon her head, becauſe of the Angels:</hi> (That ſeemeth the moſt naturall meaning of his words, for Tertullian in divers places of his
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:169390:45"/> book, <hi>De Velandis Virginibus,</hi> intimateth one reaſon of vailing womens faces in the Church, from the ſcandall of their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances) when Biſhops came over them, no marvel if they alone were called, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of thoſe Churches. For it is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that all Presbyters are called <hi>Biſhops</hi> under the Apoſtles: But when ſeverall Heads were ſet over ſeverall Churches, then Heads of Presbyteries, were onely Biſhops thenceforth. Thoſe that would have us take thoſe Angels of Churches for the Churches of thoſe Angels, rather then believe, that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles concerning thoſe Churches, were fit to be addreſſed to their Biſhops, might have corrected their miſtake out of the Scripture, that ſaith, Revel. i. 20. <hi>The ſeven Starres are the Angels of the ſeven Churches, and the ſeven Candleſticks are the ſeven Churches.</hi> S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, or whoſoever writ thoſe Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, upon 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 28. ſaith two things: Firſt, the Apoſtles, ſpoken of there, are Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops; to wit, in the then ſtate of the Church: Then, having compared the Apoſtles with Prophets, he concludeth, <hi>Et quia ab uno Deo Patre ſunt omnia, idcirco ſingulos Epiſcopos ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulis Eccleſiis praeeſſe decrevit: And becauſe all things are from one Father, God, therefore he decreed that ſeverall Biſhops ſhould be over ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Churches.</hi> In theſe two particulars he ſpeaketh my whole meaning: The Apoſtles
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:169390:45"/> were Biſhops, but not ſeverall ones of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Churches: But as there is one God over all, ſo he decreed, ſaith he, that afterwards ſeverall Biſhops ſhould be over ſeverall Churches. In the mean time, the rights re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to great Churches, over the leſſe, which now we ſee derived with ſo much learning from the times of the Apoſtles, is the print which remaineth of that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and overſight of them, which at the firſt reſted in thoſe great Churches, from which they were propagated, by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, or by their companions. Walo Meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus ſtandeth ſtiff upon S. Hieromes opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that there were no Biſhops, till they were appointed by the Church, to extinguiſh the ſchiſmes of Presbyteries. But Tertullians words inforce more, That the Biſhops of his time ſate in thoſe Chairs which the Apoſtles poſſeſſed for theirs. And afore, C. xxxii. <hi>Sicut Smyrnaeorum Eccleſia Polycarpum ab Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anne</hi> CONLOCATUM <hi>refert. As the Church at Smyrna relateth that John</hi> PLACED <hi>Polycar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> or Inſtalled him; to wit, in the Biſhops Chair there. He thinketh that all this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, that Polycarpus took place of the reſt of the Presbyters, and no more. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different reaſon will require him, to grant no more ſuperiority of Biſhops, then the Chair of the Apoſtles importeth. However S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome reconcile his opinion, with his own
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:169390:46"/> words, concerning the Presbyters of Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xandria, that from S. Marks time were wont to take one of their number, and place him on a higher ſtep, and call him <hi>Biſhop of Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xandria:</hi> common ſenſe will inforce, the high rank in which he ſate, to import the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority and eminence of his office, even during the Apoſtles time. The conſideration of this Order, or this Bench of the Church, ſhall give me further occaſion to reſume and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verre two particulars of good conſequence in this buſineſſe. The firſt, the Extent of the Office common to the Biſhop and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters; as for preaching and celebrating the Sacraments, ſo for the overſight and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church, in thoſe Spirituall matters, wherein, as members of the Church, men communicate, expreſſed in all places of the Scripture wherein there is any remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their Charge. Survaying thoſe paſſages of the Acts, and Epiſtles of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, in which the office of Presbyters is remembred, we find it every where deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, as well by the overſight, or government, or care, or whatſoever you pleaſe to call it, of the Church in Spirituall matters, as by the charge of Teaching the people. Both parts aſcribed to them that bear the rank and ſtyle of Presbyters. <hi>Acts</hi> xx. 29. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> v. 2. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> iiii. 2, 5. <hi>Titus</hi> i. 7, 9. 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> v. 22. True it is, that the Church is of it ſelf a mere Spirituall
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:169390:46"/> Common-wealth, not indued with any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall power to inforce, by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, the effect of thoſe Miniſteries which they ſtand truſted with. Before the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall powers of the world were converted to the Faith, they came to effect by the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary conſent of Chriſtians: The ſame good will, that moved them to become ſuch, was enough to prevail with them to yield effect to thoſe Miniſteries, which God had provided, for the maintenance and propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. It ſeemeth that the Ground of the preſent Separation is derived from hence, That hereupon Ordinations and Cenſures are to paſſe by voices of the Congregation according to the Scriptures. And true it is, that in the primitive Church, according to the practice of the Apoſtles times, theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters paſſed at their religious Aſſemblies, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſight and conſcience, as S. Cyprian ſpeaketh, that is, under the notice of the people. Ordinations were allowed by them, as not having to except againſt the perſons: reproofs and cenſures were their reproofs and cenſures; for they reproved, and caſt out thoſe whom the Eccleſiaſticall Order ſentenced to it. 2. Cor. ii. 6. <hi>Sufficient to ſuch an one is the rebuke by the</hi> MANY. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation muſt needs rebuke him, whom they put from their body to give effect to the Apoſtles ſentence, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 4. To ſhew us
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:169390:47"/> the meaning and extent of his words there, verſ. 12. <hi>For what have I to do to judge thoſe that are without? do not</hi> YE <hi>judge thoſe that are within?</hi> The Apoſtle cenſureth, and the people cenſureth. The difference of their right and charge is in the third verſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, in the caſe I newly have judged or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined already, that he be delivered to Satan at one of your Aſſemblies, that is, ſolemnly put from the body of Chriſtians. In regard of the faction then on foot among the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, as hath been ſhewed elſe where, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that the perſon in fault was born out by a ſide of the people; eſpecially, if we believe S. Chryſoſtome that he was one of the Paſtours. The Apoſtles were ſo charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to expect the peoples conſent in Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Cenſures, that they meant not to betray their own right with Gods cauſe. Judge whether he proceedeth upon voices, that inchargeth them to execure his ſentence, and yet he ſaith, <hi>I condemne and you candemne.</hi> But how ſhall the government of the Church in generall belong to the Eccleſiaſticall Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if the particulars of it be in the hands of the people? 1. Pet. v. 2. <hi>Feed the ſtock of God,</hi> OVERSEEING, <hi>not upon conſtraint, but willingly; not as lording it over the heritage, but as enſamples to the flock.</hi> 1.

                  <hi>muſt be blameleſſe, as the</hi> STEVVARD <hi>of God:</hi> endued with thoſe qualities that follow, not concerning preaching, but government. The like, 1. Tim. iii. 2, 3, 4, and verſ. 5. <hi>If a man know not how to rule his own houſe, how ſhall he</hi> TAKE CARE <hi>of the Church of God?</hi> Rom. xii. 8. <hi>He that</hi> RULETH <hi>with diligence.</hi> Hebr. xiii. 17. OBEY THEM THAT HAVE THE RULE OVER you, OR GUIDE you. Is all this obedience no more then to give them the hearing when they preach? Who ſhall be left to yield obedience, according to this generall charge, if the particulars of it, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations, and Cenſures belong as well to the people? Of the right of the Eccleſiaſticall Order in theſe particulars, enough hath been ſaid. And the Primitive practice of them in the Church is enough to interpret the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe Scriptures, to the common ſenſe of men that will uſe it.

Cyprian neither neglecteth the danger of Schiſme, nor ſitteth down to tell voices, which, if that were the right, in conſcience muſt carry it; but caſteth about, with authority, to reduce the people and their leaders to acknowledge themſelves. He complaineth that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was debauched by ſome of his Clergie, that ought to have kept them in diſcipline, and inſtructed them to deſire no mans recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement before Penance. <hi>Lib.</hi> iii. <hi>Ep.</hi> 14, 16.

Seeing inleſſe faults, that are not done againſt God, men do penance their due time, and come to Confeſsion upon conſideration of the life of him that doth penance, and no man can come to communicate, unleſſe firſt hands be laid on him by the Biſhop and Clergie.</hi> Shew me any ſhare of the people, in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the meaſure of Penance, or in relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the perſons, and let it be believed that the keys of Gods houſe belong to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And this is their intereſſe in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church. For they that give them right of deciding Controverſies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are mentioned in the Councell at Jeruſalem, <hi>Acts</hi> xv. 12, 22, 23. may pleaſe to conſider S.

But ſince Kingdomes and Commonwealths are become Chriſtian, the Laws of thoſe Kingdomes and Commonwealths, as they inforce the Miniſters of the Church to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:169390:49"/> their office, according to ſuch Rules as they inforce, ſo they conſtrain the people to yield outward effect to the ſame. The good order and peace of the Church cannot be preſerved otherwiſe. All this while the Office of Miniſters continueth the ſame. No part of it accrueth to the Secular powers. By becoming Chriſtians they purchaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves no more right, then the Charge of maintaining the Miniſters of the Church, in doing their Office, containeth. Onely, as all Chriſtians have the judgement of particular diſcretion to diſcharge unto God, even in matters of Religion, the account of what themſelves do: ſo is this judgement of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular diſcretion, by publick perſons, but moſt by the Sovereigne, of right imployed in all that, in which they lend or refuſe their aſſiſtance to the Miniſters of the Church in their Office, alwayes under the account due to God and to the Sovereigne. What is then the meaning of that which we reade in theſe dayes, That all Juriſdiction of the Church, exerciſed by the Miniſters of it, even that of Excommunicating (call it Juriſdiction for the preſent, though the term be proper where there is power to conſtrain) is inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and derived in and from the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, that is, in our particular from the Crown of this Kingdome? From whence it will follow by juſt and due conſequence, that
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:169390:49"/> the Office charged upon the Miniſters of the Church by the Scriptures, cannot be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them of right, ſo long as Kingdomes and Commonwealths are enemies of the Faith. So that whatſoever the Church did under the Empire, before it was converted to the Faith, was an attempt upon the Laws of it: And the Church muſt of neceſſity die, and come to nothing, for want of right to execute and propagate the Miniſteries which it ſtandeth incharged with by the Scripture. The Canoniſts have done well to diſtinguiſh between Order and Juriſdiction in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Church, provided that the ground be right underſtood, upon which theſe terms are diſtinguiſhable according to the Scriptures. That will point the effect of it to a farre other purpoſe: but we muſt not be beholden to the Canoniſts for it, being indeed this. Becauſe he that receiveth the Order of Presbyter in the Church, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, is not, of neceſſity, by the ſame Act deputed to the exerciſe of all that his Order importeth, and inableth to exerciſe, without receiving the Order anew; I ſay, by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, he is not confined, when he receiveth the Order, when, where, how, what part of thoſe things he ſhall exerciſe, which the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der inableth to do. True it is, when the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non that prohibited Ordinations without Title of Office was in force, to the true pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:169390:50"/> of it, by receiving the Order, a man was deputed to the Service of the Church, in which he received it, as a Biſhop is now when firſt he is ordained. And the nearer the Courſe of Law cometh to this Canon, the better I conceive it is, in that regard. But as this deputation was alterable, ſo was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of it of neceſſity limitable, in them that received it. What Law of God, what Command of Scripture, what Rule or Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the whole Church is there, to hinder him that is deputed to one Service, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take another, for the good of the Church? Or to inable all that have received the Order of Presbyter, for example, indifferently to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe the power of the Keys, and of Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo farre as it belongeth to that Order of right? much leſſe to exerciſe it according to their own ſenſe, and not according to Rules preſcribed by the Church. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when the Order is given, if you pleaſe to call the right of exerciſing that which it importeth, in ſuch time, and place, and ſort, as he that receiveth it is, or may be deputed to do, without receiving the Order anew, the power of Juriſdiction: this power of Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction may be given or limited by other acts beſides, though habitually, and afarre off it be contained in the Order of Presbyters, and exerciſed without receiving the Order anew, ſo ſoon as a man is deputed to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:169390:50"/> of it. If further the queſtion be made, From whom this power of Juriſdiction, that is, the right of exerciſing that which the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thus inableth to do, is derived, and in whom the power of Juriſdiction, that is, the right of giving this right reſideth, which the Canoniſts derive from the Pope upon the whole Church: The anſwer is plain, that it muſt reſt in them and be derived from them, upon whom the Government of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches, and that which falleth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, is eſtated according to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures: In as much as no Law of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth the reſt of Churches to be Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by one, further then the Law of Charity inforceth all to concurre to the unity of the whole. In the outward Juriſdiction of the Church in charitable cauſes, ſettled here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Biſhopricks, the matter is ſomewhat o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, in as much as it is not ſo ſettled by expreſſe proviſion of Scripture. And yet not ſo ſtrange from the Scripture, and that which is provided there, but that it may ſeem originally to have been derived from thence. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. The Apoſtle reproving them for impleading one another in the Courts of unbelievers ſheweth, that the Church was diſparaged in that courſe, as if it had none fit to decide their controverſies: whereas it had been better to referre their cauſes to the meaneſt of the Church, then to
<pb facs="tcp:169390:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:169390:52"/> ſue before Infidels.

For the practice of the Church argueth, that the Cuſtome grew, upon this Order of the Apoſtle, to referre their cauſes to the chief of the Church as the Church, that is, to the Biſhop and Presbyters.

So you have the Office deſcribed in all places where there is remembrance of it in the Scriptures. Onely in the words of the Apoſtle, 1. Tim. v. 17. <hi>Let the Elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour: eſpecially thoſe that labour in the Word and Doctrine,</hi> it is imagined that two kinds of Presbyters, as well as two parts of their Office, are expreſſed, one of Miniſters of the Church, another of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; one perpetuall, the other ambulatory for their time, both alike intereſſed in the Government of the Church, the Office of Preaching charged upon the one. How little of this is ſet down in the words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, were the ſenſe of them that which is pretended, let all the world judge: yet this is the ſtate of that diſcipline, which hath been preſſed, as one of the eſſentiall marks of aviſible Church.

The truth is, in that age, when the Latine tongue began to decay and corrupt, they are called <hi>Seniores,</hi> in the Authours alledged by Juſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, in the ſame ſenſe, as now in the Vulgar Languages, into which the Latine is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, <hi>Signori,</hi> or <hi>Scigneurs.</hi> And therefore there is remembrance of <hi>Seniores locorum, &amp; Seniores regni Childeberti,</hi> out of Gregory of Tours, as well as <hi>Seniores Eccleſiae:</hi> ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Aldermen of Commonalties,</hi> and <hi>Lords of the Kingdome,</hi> as well as the Chief perſons of ſuch or ſuch a people, that acknowledged the Chriſtian Faith, at ſuch time as all were not Chriſtians, but Churches and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalties
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:169390:55"/> in which they ſubſiſted, made bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies diſtinct in perſons as well as in nights.

There is yet another peremptory exception againſt this pretended meaning of the Apoſtle, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed of late in the obſervation of Sculle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, which ſhall here be repeated to averre the truth of it. For when he ſaith, <hi>Let the Elders that rule well be accounted worthy of double honour;</hi> the meaning is, for certain, of double maintenance, which muſt be in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſingle maintenance allowed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where elſe. Now let any man judge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice, whether theſe Elders of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, remembred in S. Auguſtines
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:169390:55"/> time, being none of the Clergie, received maintenance from the Church, out of the oblations of the people, or not. Whereas the Apoſtle in the beginning of the Chapter having ſaid, <hi>Honour widows that are widows indeed,</hi> that is, allow them maintenance from the means of the Church, which the Biſhop alwayes diſpenſed; when he cometh to ſpeak of Elders unreproveable in their charge, fitly ordereth, that their maintenance be double to that of widows, which is alſo the Italian gloſſe of Diodati. The like pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice we find in the Conſtitutions of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, where he ordereth the courſe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding portions, at the Agapae or Feaſts of Love then uſed, abrogated afterwards by the xxvii.

                  </gap>. <hi>Let the Deacons diſtribute the remains of the bleſsings at the myſteries, according to the mind of the Biſhop or Presbyters to the Clergie: To the Biſhop foure parts; to a Presbyter three; to a Deacon two; to the reſt, Subdeacons, Readers, Singers, or Deaconeſſes one part.</hi> Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe from the particular remembred afore, we may well conclude the meaning of the Apoſtle, that his Order is, the maintenance of Presbyters to be double that of wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows. And upon theſe conſiderations it ſhall not trouble me to repeat what I have affirmed elſewhere, That for this miſtake of Lay-Elders there is neither appearance in Scripture, nor in Eccleſiaſticall writers. For of the Text, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 28. I ſhall ſpeak after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Walo Meſſalinus deriveth the pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of theſe Africane Elders, by conjecture, from thoſe of the Apoſtle, whoſe imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conſiſted in governing the Church, rather then in teaching the people. But out of his excellent learning he acknowledgeth, that though they are called <hi>Eccleſiaſticall perſons,</hi> yet they were not of the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Order, not of the Bench of the Church, which thoſe of the Apoſtle did conſtitute. And therefore the pretence of their pedigree availeth not to make them inherit the charge
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:169390:56"/> which thoſe of our time have been inveſted with, as much without preſident of the Churches of Africk, as without warrant from the Scriptures. The ground of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take was, becauſe men would not believe, that in the time of the Apoſtles, and among the Presbyters of their ordaining, there was none that did not preach from time to time. Whereas the ſtate and condition of their Congregations required as well mens wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and goodneſſe, in the overſight of thoſe ſpirituall matters, wherein the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of them did communicate, as their learning and eloquence in ſpeaking, which was not alwayes to be expected from ſuch qualities of men as were promoted to that charge. Of our Lords kindred that confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him afore Domitian, promoted therefore afterwards to the Government of Churches, I have made mention elſewhere. Tertull. de Idol. c. 7. <hi>Parum ſit ſi ab aliis manibus accipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant quod contaminant, ſed etiam ipſi tradunt aliis quod contaminaverunt. Adleguntur in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinem Eccleſiaſticum artifices Idolorum. Be it a ſmall thing, if they receive of others that which they pollute, nay themſelves deliver alſo to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that which they have polluted. Men whoſe craft is to make Idoles are choſen to the Bench of the Church.</hi> If Presbyters, that delivered the Euchariſt, were ſometimes Painters and Carvers in thoſe dayes, well may we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:169390:57"/> that all of them preached not alwayes: It was enough that the Biſhop or ſome of them did it. If this were the condition of the Eccleſiaſticall Order in that time, then muſt of neceſſity the Office of Teaching in the Church belong rather to the particular gifts and abilites of ſome, then to the generall and perpetuall charge of all Presbyters. And this I ſtill ſuppoſe to be part of the cauſe, that it pleaſed God in the time of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, to diſtribute ſuch varieties of ſpirituall Graces among thoſe that believed, that there might be every where ſuch as might furniſh this Office of preaching and teaching in their Aſſemblies, by the help of extraordinary Graces, which upon the ordinary means of mens Learning and Studies, which now the Church is ſo well provided with, would then have proved defective. The uſe of theſe Graces is that which the Apoſtle debateth at large, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. xiiii. and the expoſition of his meaning there, is the buſineſſe which henceforth I charge my ſelf with. The iſſue whereof will inable us to diſcern by what ſorts of Perſons and Graces the publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God was Miniſtred at thoſe Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, which his purpoſe in that Diſcourſe is to regulate. This Diſcourſe the Apoſtle openeth in the beginning of the xii. Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, with a mark to diſcern ſuch as ſpoke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed by the Spirit of God, from ſuch as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:169390:57"/> it, but were moved in truth by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Spirits. For that I take to be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his words there, verſ. 3. <hi>Wherefore I give you to underſtand, that no man ſpeaking by the Spirit of God, calleth Jeſus accurſed,</hi> or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathema: <hi>and that no man can ſay, that Jeſus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> The words of S. Chryſoſtome upon this place: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. That is, <hi>Therefore at the firſt beginning he putteth down the difference between Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Propheſying, for which purpoſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Gift of diſcerning ſpirits,</hi> (as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth verſ. 10. afterwards) <hi>that they might diſtinguiſh, and know, who ſpake by a clean ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and who by an unclean.</hi> And again, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>For the devil being naught, ſhuffled in among thoſe that propheſyed, foiſting in Falſe-prophets, forſooth ſuch as themſelves alſo foretold things to come.</hi> So that in his judgement, the words of the Apoſtle are not generall, to affirm that no man could call Jeſus LORD but by the Holy Ghoſt, but relate to the particular whereof he ſpeaketh; to tell us, that ſuch as pretended to ſpeak by the Holy Ghoſt, if they glorified our Lord Chriſt, then were they what they pretended to be, otherwiſe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:169390:58"/> not. As who ſhould ſay, That it was not in them to perſiſt in their counterfeiting, when it was required of them to confeſſe Chriſt. For we know that in the Primitive times, at the naming of JESUS, unclean ſpirits forſook the poſſeſſed. And thus S. Chryſoſtome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth, That ſhe which had the unclean ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>Acts</hi> xvi. 16. confeſſed Chriſt indeed, but unwillingly, and ſo, as ſhe was diſcovered by it. For being a thing evident, that men did and might counterfeit themſelves Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and call Jeſus LORD, with a tongue ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moved by the evil ſpirit, it ſeemeth an inconvenience to grant, that all men, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Chriſt, ſpeak by the Holy Ghoſt, in regard of the truth which they confeſſe. But it is reaſonable to conceive, that God ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not thoſe that pretended to ſpirituall Graces (of whom the Apoſtle propoundeth there to ſpeak in particular) being moved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed by the evil ſpirit. This ſenſe I embrace, becauſe the ſame mark is laid down ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by another Apoſtle, to the ſame purpoſe, 1. John iiii. 1. <hi>Beloved, believe not every ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but try the ſpirits, whether they are of God, becauſe many falſe-prophets are gone out into the world: Hereby know ye the Spirit of God; every ſpirit that confeſſeth that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, is of God. And every ſpirit that confeſſeth not that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, is not of God. Spirits,</hi> the Apoſtle
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:169390:58"/> here calleth <hi>Inſpirations,</hi> as in S. Paul, 1. Cor. xii. 10. <hi>diſcerning of</hi> SPIRITS, that is, <hi>Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations:</hi> And, 1 Cor. xiv. 12. <hi>becauſe ye are zealous of</hi> SPIRITS, that is, <hi>of ſpirituall Graces.</hi> And the difference between his mark to try them by and S. Paul's, is but this: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the one, <hi>He that acknowledgeth Jeſus the Meſsias to be come in the fleſh;</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the other, <hi>He that acknowledgeth Jeſus that is come in the fleſh, to be the Lord, he it is that ſpeaketh by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> The ſame is the meaning of the Apoſtle, 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> v. 19, 20. according to the ſame S. Chryſoſtome: where having ſaid, <hi>Quench not the Spirit, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe not Propheſying,</hi> he addeth immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Try all things, hold fast that which is good:</hi> inſtructing them in the particular in hand, to examine all that pretended to theſe ſpirituall Graces, by the Gift of diſcerning ſpirits, which God then allowed the Church for that purpoſe; and to make uſe of ſuch as proved that which they profeſſed. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of this Diſcourſe of the Apoſtle then, concerneth thoſe Graces of the Holy Ghoſt that conſiſted in ſpeaking, whereof therefore there might be uſe in publick Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, which his purpoſe is to order by ſuch Rules as we ſhall ſee him propound in the end of the fourteenth Chapter of this Epiſtle. But this to do, he fetcheth a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe about, and lancheth into a generall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:169390:59"/> of all manner of Graces, all manner of Miniſteries, all manner of works that have relation to the publick body of the Church; to ſhew, that all were given and intended, not for the eminence of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons on whom they were beſtowed, but for the publick benefit. This is the point to which he proceedeth, verſ. 4. <hi>Now, there are diverſities of Gifts, but the ſame Spirit; and there are differences of Adminiſtrations, but the ſame Lord. And there are diverſities of Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but it is the ſame God that worketh all in all. But the Adminiſtration of the Spirit is given every man to profit withall.</hi> It concerneth not the purpoſe of my diſcourſe here, to be nice in inquiring the difference between Graces, and Miniſteries, and Operations, remembred here by the Apoſtle. It is enough to obſerve, that the name of MINISTERIES is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times particular for thoſe that are called <hi>Deacons,</hi> from the Originall word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, becauſe they miniſtred to the Apoſtles, to the Biſhop, and Presbyters, for diſcharge of their Office: ſometimes generall, for all kind of Service, in regard of him to whom it addreſſeth. For as concerning the force of the word, as the Apoſtle ſaith here, <hi>There are differences of Miniſteries, but the ſame Lord;</hi> ſo generally that which is done in ſervice to any perſon, that perſon is the <hi>Lord,</hi> and thoſe ſervices in his regard are <hi>Miniſteries.</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:169390:59"/> Indeed, the Apoſtle, when he ſaith in the next words, <hi>The manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withall,</hi> manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceedeth to ſpeak of none but miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, demonſtrating the preſence thereof in the Church. Though the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is generall in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſignifying all manner of Gifts proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Favour and Grace, as it is tranſlated in the Syriack, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſignifying <hi>Gifts:</hi> Whereas <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Operations,</hi> ſeemeth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to relate to ſuch Graces as tended to miraculous works, and is therefore ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in the Syriack <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſignifying <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull Operations.</hi> Thus it is true which S. Chryſoſtome writeth upon this Chapter, in the beginning: Becauſe thoſe that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from Idoles knew not the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Holy Ghoſt is inviſible, God gave in theſe Graces a ſenſible evidence of the operation of it: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>And this,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>manifeſted to thoſe that were without the Church, that the Holy Ghoſt is in him that ſpeaketh. Therefore ſo he calleth it, ſaying,</hi> BUT TO EVERY ONE IS GIVEN THE MANIFESTATION OF THE SPIRIT TO PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FIT VVITH: <hi>calling Gifts, the manifeſtation of the Spirit.</hi> And Oecumenius according to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:169390:60"/> him, Though this be true, yet the Proceſſe of the Apoſtles diſcourſe, from verſ. 12. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth not onely to compriſe miraculous Graces, but all Miniſteries ordained for the publick Service of the Church, whether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on miraculous Graces or not: as appeareth both by the reaſon whereupon he proceedeth, and by the catalogue, wherein, from verſ. 8. he recapitulateth and reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the particulars of all that can be reduced under thoſe heads of Graces, of Miniſteries, of Operations. For the reaſon wherewith the Apoſtle purſueth this point propoſed, that all theſe are intended, not to make the perſons eminent in whom they are, but for publick benefit, is the compariſon of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall body and the members of it, whereof there is none that envieth or deſpiſeth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: to teach private perſons not to grudge at them upon whom publick Graces or Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are beſtowed; and them not to deſpiſe private perſons. This compariſon the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſetteth on foot alſo in his Epiſtle to the Romanes, but ſlighteth it over more in brief there, becauſe (as S. Chryſoſtome thinketh) it ſeemeth, the abuſe againſt which he writeth, as it was alſo there, ſo was it more rife among the Corinthians. This rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it is plain, concerneth thoſe that have publick Miniſteries no leſſe then thoſe that have miraculous Graces; both being for the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:169390:60"/> common benefit of the body, which is the Church. But the Apoſtle having enlarged this compariſon to the full in this place, to ſhew to whom he ſpeaketh as members of publick places, proceedeth verſ. 28. to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularize all to whom his Exhortation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth, Apoſtles, Prophets, and the reſt; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom he reckoneth <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, <hi>Helps,</hi> and <hi>Governments;</hi> which our Engliſh rendereth <hi>Helps in Governments:</hi> which whether they mean miraculous Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſuch as the Apoſtle calleth <hi>The Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of the Spirit,</hi> or Miniſteries of publick Service in the Church, I referre to further conſideration afterwards. In the mean time obſerving, that the Apoſtle, writing to the Romanes for the ſame purpoſe, hath reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more particulars of the ſame nature not neceſſarily proceeding from miraculous Graces, though his diſcourſe there, xii. 6. compriſeth thoſe alſo, when he ſaith, <hi>Having ſeverall Gifts according to the Grace that is given to us.</hi> For the preſent, we may ſee what this whole diſcourſe of the Apoſtle aymeth at, by the concluſion of the Chapter, where he ſaith, <hi>Covet earneſtly the beſt Gifts: and yet ſhew I unto you a more excellent way.</hi> For this Exhortation it is that tyeth all that hath paſſed with that which followeth. The Syriack readeth it thus, <hi>If ye be zealous of the beſt Graces, I will yet ſhew you a more excellent</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:169390:61"/> 
                  <hi>way.</hi> Theodoret and Oecumenius make a queſtion of it, thus; <hi>Are ye zealous of the moſt eminent Graces? I will yet ſhew you a way beyond them all.</hi> But whether the meaning be to exhort them to purſue the moſt uſefull Graces, or to ſuppoſe that they did it, thus much for certain his intent is, to give the ground and reaſon why all members of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Service in the Church are not to ſeek the eminence of their perſons, but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon benefit: becauſe there is a thing called <hi>The common Charity of Chriſtians,</hi> more avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able towards the eſteem of all mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, be they never ſo private in the Church with God, then all thoſe Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, that appear ſo marvellous to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe. This is the occaſion of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon which followeth throughout the thirteenth Chapter, between the common Charity of Chriſtians, and their particular miraculous Graces: which being diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there, in good time doth the Apoſtle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to reſume that which he had propoſed afore, and upon this occaſion intermitted, concerning zeal and ſtudy for the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Graces, which he tyeth up with that Charity which hitherto he hath preferred to them all in that propoſition which he openeth the fourteenth Chapter with, <hi>Follow after Charity and deſire ſpirituall Gifts, but rather that ye may Propheſie.</hi> For when he
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:169390:61"/> preferreth Propheſying before other ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Gifts, it is plain enough what he meant when he ſaid before, <hi>Be zealous of the beſt Graces:</hi> a thing in which there can be no doubt, becauſe it is the ſubject of what is behind in this Diſcourſe. Now let me lay down the words of the Apoſtle wherein he reckoneth in particular the Graces and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Church. 1. Cor. xii. 28. <hi>And God hath ſet ſome in the Church, firſt Apoſtles, ſecondarily Prophets, thirdly Teachers, after that Miracles, then gifts of Healing, Helps in Governments, diverſities of Tongues,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we may adde out of verſ. 29. <hi>Interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Tongues.</hi> And herewith compare the Catalogue of the ſame, which he compriſeth under the name of <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Graces,</hi> Rom. xii. 6, 7, 8. <hi>Having then gifis differing according to the grace that is given to us; whether Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, let us Propheſie according to the proportion of faith: Or Miniſtery, let us wait on our Miniſtring: Or he that Teacheth, on Teaching: Or he that Exhorteth, on Exhortation: He that Giveth, let him do it with ſimplicity: He that Ruleth, with diligence: He that ſheweth Mercy, with chearfulneſſe.</hi> That which followeth, concerneth the particular virtues of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and the works of them, as <hi>Love, Hope, Patience,</hi> and the like: ſuch as are alſo thoſe that went afore, <hi>of giving and ſhewing mercie,</hi> which the Apoſtle hath ranked among thoſe
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:169390:62"/> Graces which tend to the generall good of the Church, it ſeemeth, becauſe they alſo reſpect the benefit of others. Laſt of all, adde unto theſe the Miniſteries which the Grace of Chriſt, upon his Aſſcenſion, poured out upon the Church, appointeth; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſame Apoſtle, Epheſ. iiii. 11, 12. <hi>And he gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtours and Teachers; for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtery, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt.</hi> By which words, as well as by the particulars which he putteth down, and which he leaveth out, of thoſe which he reckoneth in the other places, it appeareth that he intended (according to the purpoſe of his ſpeech there) to compriſe none but thoſe Graces and Miniſteries which tend to the edification of the whole Church in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of doctrine. But writing to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, his intent was to ſet down all manner of Graces and Miniſteries tending to the common benefit of the whole Church ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſpirituall or corporall neceſſities, in working miracles, and the like: none where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he mentioneth to the Romanes, neither the Graces of Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, it ſeemeth, becauſe they are Graces and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces not confined to one Church in particular. Theſe Catalogues are here compared for the eaſe and direction of them that deſire to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:169390:62"/> judge of ſuch particulars as ſeem not yet out of doubt in the Miniſteries appointed by the Apoſtles. To which purpoſe we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume what hath been elſewhere obſerved, That nothing hindereth divers of the Graces ſpecified to meet in the ſame perſon. For though we ſuppoſe, as the Apoſtle ſeemeth to ſuppoſe, all Miniſteries to be accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Graces which the diſcharge of them requireth: as the Elders of Iſrael, <hi>Num.</hi> xi. 25. received part of Moſes his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and though all Graces inferre Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as he that is indued with any of the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſpecified to the Corinthians, miniſtreth the effect of his grace to the benefit of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; yet there is a difference between Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteries of publick office in the Church, whether to ceaſe or continue, and Graces which inable either a publick perſon to a publick, or private perſons to a particular work, as that of Miracles. Severall Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of publick place in the Church, muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to ſeverall perſons; but publick perſons are capable as well of the Graces which pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons have, as of thoſe that belong to their publick charge, including perhaps the Graces of inferiour Miniſteries. And the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the firſt in the Catalogue ſhall put this out of doubt, that is of Apoſtles. For nothing hindereth an Apoſtle to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, to ſpeak ſtrange languages, to work
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:169390:63"/> miracles, or the like. The Commentaries under S. Ambroſe his name, <hi>Quamvis ſint &amp; Apoſtoli Prophetae, quia primus gradus reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quos ſubjectos habet. Though,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Apoſtles alſo are Prophets, becauſe the chief degree hath the reſt ſubject to it.</hi> His meaning is, the Grace of Apoſtles containeth the Graces of inferiour Miniſters, as their miniſteries are ſubject to that of the Apoſtles. Evangeliſts were no Apoſtles but their miniſters in uſing their Graces to ſecond the Apoſtles, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Grace of Apoſtles containeth that of Evangeliſts. Prophets were no Apoſtles to preach the Faith and plant Churches, but for the inſtruction of Churches planted in the knowledge of the Scriptures; but the Grace of a Prophet to all purpoſes might be in an Apoſtle. Doctours were no Apoſtles, but Apoſtles chief of Doctours. Elders of Churches could not be Apoſtles, they were from the beginning ordained for the ſervice of ſeverall Churches, but the Apoſtles make themſelves their fellow Elders in regard to the Government of all Churches of their charge. If Presbyters, much more Biſhops, (which as Heads of Presbyters) were that in one Church which the Apoſtles were in all of their own planting and charge. Thoſe companions of the Apoſtles where of you have heard, are ſome of them called in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe terms <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> and the Office may
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:169390:63"/> well be thought to belong to the reſt. Titus, Clemens, Linus, Eraſtus, and others, may upon good preſumption be called <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts;</hi> as thoſe are to whom their condition is ſo anſwerable, Mark, Luke, Timothy, that are ſo called in Scripture, or ſo reputed in Eccleſiaſticall Writers. My conjecture was, that they were ſent by their ſeverall Churches, as Timothy from that of Lyſtra, <hi>Acts</hi> xvi. 3. as Deacons to miniſter unto the Apoſtles, Heads of thoſe Churches for the time that they continued in their attendance; and by them imployed to preach the Goſpel at their appointment in ſuch places where themſelves could not, in regard of the Grace given them to do it. As Philip, Deacon to the Apoſtles firſt, and afterwards to S. James, was alſo an Evangeliſt to preach the Goſpel to Samaria, <hi>Acts</hi> viii. 5. xxi. 8. And I ſee no cauſe to repent of this conjecture, reading thus, Acts xix. 22. <hi>So he ſent before two of thoſe that</hi> MINISTRED <hi>unto him,</hi> Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motheus and Eraſtus. It is the word from whence Deacons have their name. But when they received the charge of Churches, though Biſhops of thoſe Churches, yet cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed they not to be Evangeliſts, for the charge of propagating the Goſpel through the Countreys ſeated underneath the Cities of thoſe Churches. Thus was Mark at Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xandria, Timothy at Epheſus, Titus at Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyna
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:169390:64"/> in Crete: the reſt are to be ſeen in Walo Meſſalinus, <hi>p.</hi> cxcii. He ſuppoſeth that theſe companions of the Apoſtles are themſelves alſo called <hi>Apoſtles</hi> of a ſecond rank, as ſent by the Apoſtles to preach the Goſpel at their diſpoſing, as the Apoſtles were by Chriſt to preach the Goſpel every where without reſtraint. And there is appearance of this ſenſe, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> iii. 2. <hi>Apoc.</hi> ii. 2. (not in <hi>Phil.</hi> ii. 25. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> viii. 23. where Epaphrodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus and others are called <hi>Apoſtles of Churches,</hi> in a third ſenſe, declared elſewhere, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to thoſe Apoſtles of the Synagogue, mentioned in the Conſtitutions of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours that were ſent through the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues to gather the dues of their Patriarch reſiding in Paleſtine.) And Theodoret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth, that when all Presbyters were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Biſhops,</hi> then Biſhops were called <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> in this ſenſe. But we muſt not underſtand thoſe to be the Apoſtles of whom this place ſpeaketh, but the firſt Apoſtles of Chriſt: For thoſe that are thus called <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> are the ſame that are called <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> here, and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> iiii. 12. Thus there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Graces and Miniſteries. But as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Office of <hi>Doctours</hi> mentioned by the Apoſtle, it may be two wayes under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. The Diſciples of Prophets under the Old Teſtament, ſuch as attained not to the Grace of immediate inſpiration, but reſted
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:169390:64"/> in that knowledge which the ordinary bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God upon their ſtudies was able to compaſſe, in the Scripture are called <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> in the Chaldee Paraphraſe are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times tranſlated <hi>Scribes,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Doctours,</hi> as hath been ſaid. Some man may conceive the like of the Prophets of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that their Diſciples, that had no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate inſpirations, were admitted to teach in the Church, which after this rank of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets was ceaſed, came alſo to nothing. But becauſe there is no mention of any ſuch in Eccleſiaſticall Writers, there is no reaſon to doubt that the men whom the Apoſtle here calleth <hi>Doctours,</hi> are thoſe of the Presbyters which had the abilities of Preaching and Teaching the people at their Aſſemblies; that thoſe of the Presbyters that preached not, are called here by the Apoſtle <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and the Deacons <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, <hi>Helps,</hi> or <hi>Aſsiſtants</hi> to the Government of Presbyters; ſo that it is not to be tranſlated <hi>Helps in Governments,</hi> but <hi>Helps, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> For we are not here to imagine that the Apoſtle reckoning one by one the liſt of all Graces and Miniſteries of the Church, ſhould ſay never a word of Presbyters and Deacons, the onely Miniſteries of Succeſſion in the Church under Biſhops. Now the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Deacons, though ſet up at the firſt upon occaſion of miniſtring the Oblations
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:169390:65"/> of the faithfull to the neceſſities of the poor, yet if we regard the practice of it in the times next the Apoſtles, cannot be better expreſſed then calling them <hi>Aſsiſtants</hi> to the Office of Government reſting in the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, when there was no Biſhop at Corinth. And we have here a particular reaſon why the Apoſtle would not call them by the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all name of <hi>Deacons</hi> in this place, becauſe he had uſed it before in a generall ſenſe, when he ſaid, <hi>There be divers</hi> MINISTERIES, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>but one</hi> LORD, and therefore could not ſo well uſe it again here in this particular ſenſe. And the Apoſtles intent here being to diſtinguiſh all Graces in his Catalogue, and having ſhewed that there were two parts of the Presbyters Office, in Teaching and Governing, the one whereof ſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained not, even in the Apoſtles time: it is reaſonable to imagine, that the Office and Miniſtery of Presbyters is ſpecified here in the names of theſe two Graces, in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe whereof it conſiſteth. No otherwiſe then in the other place to the Romanes, in theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, are deſigned the ſame two Graces, in the work whereof conſiſteth the Office of Presbyters: which he that acknowledgeth, ſhall give reaſon enough why the Apoſtle reckoneth the Gift of EXHORTATION there, beſides that of DOCTRINE; being no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:169390:65"/> to make ſeverall parts of this Grace, tending to the edification of the Church, according to that which ſeverall men are moſt able to do, though all may be compriſed under one name of DOCTRINE. Whereas thoſe that upon the mention of Teaching imagine a ſeverall Miniſtery of Doctours, inſtituted by the Apoſtle for all ages of the Church, are tyed in conſequence to ſet up the like for Exhortation, which is ridiculous. Again, hereby we give account what the Apoſtle to the Epheſians under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth by PASTOURS AND TEACHERS, to wit, thoſe that exerciſed alſo that part of the Presbyters Office which concerned the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Church in doctrine, whereof there he ſpeaketh, and of nothing elſe. And thereupon conclude, that Paſtours and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours are both one there with the Apoſtle. For what reaſon elſe can be rendered why there is no remembrance of Paſtours in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thoſe other places wherein the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle maketh a more particular reckoning of the Miniſteries of the Church, both to the Romanes and to the Corinthians? What reaſon but this, Becauſe they are ſet down in both places under the name of DO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CTOURS? Well may it ſeem, that the Office of them whom the Synagogue called PA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STOURS, being referred in the Church to the inferiour Order of Deacons, the name ſtuck
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:169390:66"/> upon thoſe that miniſtred the food of the ſoul in the Church which is for the purpoſe of it. Clemens <hi>Epiſt. ad Cor. p.</hi> 63. <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:169390:66"/> bore ſway among the people. In fine, the Apoſtle intendeth by <hi>Doctours,</hi> the ſame that are ſo called in all Eccleſiaſticall Writers, that is, the Biſhops, or ſuch of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as were ſeen in Preaching. It is worth the obſerving, that Beza hath expounded thoſe whom the Apoſtle calleth <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, no otherwiſe then <hi>Deacons</hi> and <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters;</hi> meaning indeed thoſe Elders of the people, which he imagined. But having ſhewed that there never was any ſuch in the Church, well may we take his judgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with ſo much of the truth as he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth; which deſerveth ſtill more credit from the Preſident of Synagogues, which had Elders, ſome learned ſome not, ſome that preached and ſome that did not, as hath been ſaid. Salmaſius of late, in his work <hi>De Foenore Trapezit.</hi> hath ſhown ſome evidence of two ſorts of Presbyters, in the firſt times of the Church. But according to his admirable knowledge, he ſaw withall, that they were all of one rank in the Church, all of the Eccleſiaſticall Order, all made by Impoſition of hands; and by conſequence, none of thoſe Elders of the people which have been ſet up to manage the keys of the Church, that is, the Office of the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Order, according to the Scriptures. Beſides, it is to be obſerved, that the Office of Biſhops (which name he thinketh moſt
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:169390:67"/> proper to thoſe Presbyters which preached not, but were exerciſed in ordering Church-matters) and Presbyters is deſcribed almoſt in all places where there is mention of it in the Scriptures by both qualities, of Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Governing the Church. Which is my argument to conclude, That howſoever ſome mens abilities might be ſeen in the one rather then in the other, howſoever ſome men according to their abilities might be applied to this rather then to that, yet both Offices concerned the whole Order, that of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in chief. To which though ſome attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, yet all are incouraged to labour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it as the moſt excellent work of their place, as by S. Paul, allowing them that dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble maintenance, ESPECIALLY in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect: So by theſe Conſtitutions, allowing them that double portion at their Feaſts of Love, for that purpoſe, <hi>that they may take pains in the Word of Doctrine,</hi> as the words go there. Be it then reſolved, that the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Church, at leaſt part of them, were thoſe Doctours whereof the Apoſtle writeth; and from thence be it conſidered, what diſtempers ſlight miſtakes in the ſound of the Scripture bring to paſſe, when we ſee the Order of Doctours, diſtinct from that of Presbyters, preſſed as a point of that Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline that maketh one of the eſſentiall marks of a viſible Church. But whether the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:169390:67"/> of the Primitive Church, which taught the people at their Aſſemblies, were Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or not, is not ſo eaſie to determine. Some of them we have reaſon enough to think were, be it but for thoſe Prophets of Antiochia, <hi>Acts</hi> xiii. 2. that miniſtred unto the Lord and faſted, when the Holy Ghoſt ſaid unto them, <hi>Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have appointed them;</hi> and thoſe other among whom Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy received Impoſition of hands with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> iv. 14. But that all Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters were Prophets, or all Prophets Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, is more then I can reſolve. Of theſe Prophets henceforth we are to intreat.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>IN the beginning of the Chriſtian Faith, it pleaſed God, for the propagation and maintenance of it, to revive the Grace of Propheſying, decayed and loſt among his Ancient people, in a large meaſure, in moſt of the Churches planted by the Apoſtles: though there be not found ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Office any where as in this Church of Corinth. In the Church of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, the mother of all Churches, Acts xi. 27. <hi>And in thoſe dayes came Prophets from Jeruſalem to Antiochia.</hi> xv. 32. <hi>And Judas and Silas being Prophets alſo themſelves.</hi> In the Church of Antiochia, Acts xiii. 1. <hi>Now there were in the Church that was at Antiochia, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Prophets and Doctours.</hi> At Theſſalonica, 1. Theſſ. v. 20. <hi>Deſpiſe not Propheſying.</hi> At Corinth, as we ſee at large. At Epheſus, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ. iv. 11. <hi>And he gave ſome Apoſtles, ſome Evangeliſts, ſome Prophets, ſome Paſtours and Doctours.</hi> At Rome, Rom. xii. 6. <hi>Whether Propheſie, according to the proportion of Faith.</hi> And ſetting theſe particulars aſide, how ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall the Grace was, is to be ſeen, becauſe
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:169390:68"/> the Apoſtle reckoning, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 28. all members of publick uſe and ſervice, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> iv. 11. all Miniſteries of edification, nameth <hi>Prophets</hi> among them whom God hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Church. Beſides this Grace, which was more for the edification of them that believed, inſtructing them in the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our Faith at their Religious Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, the Grace of ſpeaking ſtrange Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages was alſo beſtowed upon the Churches to make evidence to unbelievers that the Holy Ghoſt was preſent there, and by that means, to draw them to believe, as the Apoſtle ſaith here, 1. Cor. xiiii. 22. <hi>Tongues are a ſigne not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but propheſying ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not for them that believe not, but for them that believe:</hi> containing in it a Preface to that which God now intended to do, in bringing all Nations and Languages to the acknowledgement of him that was hitherto confined to one people, ſo that when the Goſpel was received, his praiſes ſhould ſound in all kind of Languages. For it is not to be imagined, as if the Gift of Languages that maketh ſo much noiſe in this Epiſtle, and in the Scriptures elſewhere, conſiſted merely in ſpeaking in an unknown Tongue, and not in the ſubject ſuggeſted to them by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to ſpeak. It is plain beſides, that it was the praiſes of God, and thoſe myſteries of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:169390:69"/> the knowledge of God, which thoſe that had the Gift could not reach to of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt to expreſſe in unknown Languages. So it is ſaid of the Apoſtles when firſt they received this Grace, Acts ii. 4. <hi>And they were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and began to ſpeak with other tongues, as the ſpirit gave them ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance.</hi> And to ſhew further what matters they uttered, the company aſſembled ſay of them, verſ. 7. <hi>We do heare them ſpeak in our tongues the wonderfull works of God.</hi> As it is ſaid of them which were with Cornelius, Acts x. 46. <hi>They heard them ſpeak with tongues, and magnifie God.</hi> And upon this ground it is, that Saint Peter expoundeth the paſſage of the Prophet Joel, <hi>And it ſhall come to paſſe in the laſt dayes, ſaith God, I will poure out of my ſpirit upon all fleſh, and your ſonnes and your daughters ſhall propheſie, and your young men ſhall ſee viſions, and your old men ſhall dream dreams,</hi> of the Apoſtles when they ſpake in ſtrange Languages. To ſhew us, that the matters uttered in ſtrange Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, were the like as the Prophets revealed, the Gift of unknown Tongues over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove. From whence we may perceive the meaning of that which the Apoſtle hath ſet down here, verſ. 2. <hi>For he that ſpeaketh in an unknown tongue, ſpeaketh not unto men, but unto God; for no man underſtandeth him, howbeit in</hi>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:169390:69"/> 
                  <hi>the ſpirit he ſpeaketh</hi> MYSTERIES. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, verſ. 4. <hi>He that ſpeaketh in an unknown tongue, edifieth himſelf.</hi> Where you have in plain terms, that thoſe things which the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt moved men to ſpeak in ſtrange Languages were for the inſtruction of thoſe that had the Grace, in the myſteries of Gods Kingdome. For this reaſon the Gift of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages is compared with that of PROPHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SYING throughout this whole xiiii. Chapter of the firſt to the Corinthians, with intent to regulate the uſe of both at their religious Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies. So that it ſeemeth all ſpirituall Graces are by the Apoſtle referred to theſe two kinds, in that difference which he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth from the beginning, <hi>Be zealous of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Gifts, but rather of</hi> PROPHESYING: Where I muſt allow Beza's Tranſlation to be more exact then that which we uſe. For where he ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. it is plain, that Propheſying is of the number of ſpirituall Graces; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to be excepted, in oppoſition to them; as if the Apoſtle exhorted to ſtudy Propheſying rather then ſpirituall Graces: but as it is tranſlated there, to be zealous of ſpirituall Graces, but of all ſpirituall Graces ESPECIALLY of that of Propheſying. Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenius thus gloſſeth the words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <hi>Graces, and eſpecially that of Propheſying;</hi> to the ſame ſenſe, which is the true meaning of the words.

And whether thoſe particulars which the Apoſtle here expreſſeth xii. 8. when he ſaith, <hi>For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wiſdome; to another the word of</hi>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:169390:70"/> 
                  <hi>knowledge by the ſame ſpirit;</hi> whether theſe, I ſay, be of the ſame nature, limbes of this Gift of Propheſying, and of immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration or not, is reſolved both by the terms which the Apoſtle uſeth when he ſaith, <hi>To one is given the word of wiſdome by the</hi> SPIRIT, <hi>to another the word of knowledge by the ſame</hi> SPIRIT: for thoſe things which are given by the Spirit are inſpirations in this place. And by the conſequence of his ſpeech, having ſaid afore, <hi>The manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit with:</hi> for the manifeſtation of the Spirit are thoſe Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by which the preſence of the Holy Ghoſt in the Church was made manifeſt. And we ſee in what particulars the Apoſtle further ſpecifieth this Grace, in oppoſition to that of Languages, xiv. 6. <hi>Now, Brethren, if I come unto you with Tongues, what ſhall I profit you, except I ſhall ſpeak to you, either by</hi> REVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LATION, <hi>or by</hi> KNOVVLEDGE, <hi>or by</hi> PROPHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SYING, <hi>or by</hi> DOCTRINE. Theſe are all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars compriſed within the compaſſe of that Grace which the Apoſtle intendeth to advance beyond that of Languages, and in verſ. 1. and elſewhere goeth under the name of PROPHESYING. And therefore I am apt to think, that in this text the word PROPHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SYING ſtandeth in a particular ſenſe, to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie foretelling of things to come: As it doth alſo, <hi>Chap.</hi> xii. 10. For the Apoſtle having
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:169390:71"/> ſaid, verſ. 8. <hi>To one is given the word of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome by the Spirit, to another the word of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by the ſame Spirit</hi> (which are both mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Grace of Propheſying in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of it, as appeareth Chap. xiii. 3. <hi>And though I have the Gift of Propheſie, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand all myſteries and all knowledge)</hi> addeth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe, verſ. 10. <hi>To another is given the working of miracles, to another Propheſie;</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing the Grace of foretelling things to come, from the wiſdome and knowledge inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt, which are all ſometimes comprehended under one Grace of Propheſying. But that which the Apoſtle calleth REVELATION, is without doubt the diſcloſing of ſecrets. That I take to be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſſe, by what we find afterwards, verſ. 24, 25. <hi>But if all Propheſie, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all, and thus are the ſecrets of his heart made manifeſt, and ſo fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down on his face, he will worſhip God, and report that God is among you of atruth.</hi> S.

                  <hi>he came in to try, with an evil mind, or with a ſound one; and that he hath done this or that, for this is much more terrible and uſefull then that.</hi> To this purpoſe he alledgeth Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzars act, falling down before Daniel up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the diſcovery of his dream, ii. 47. And that under the Old Teſtament, Revealing of ſecrets was a thing required at their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets hands. By the way we may perceive by that which Saul and his Fathers ſervants did, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> ix. 6. repairing to Samuel to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of his Fathers Aſſes that were ſtrayed. From whence we muſt conclude, that this Grace of PROPHESYING, under the New Teſtament, was of immediate inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, to all purpoſes as under the Old. For you ſhall find, verſ. 30. <hi>If Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be made to another that ſitteth by, let the firſt hold his peace:</hi> To ſhew us, that ſome were inſpired upon the very point of time with the truth of matters in debate at their Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, as was Jehaziell ſonne of Zachariah, at the meeting which Joſaphat had aſſembled, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> xx. 14. As were thoſe by whom Paul and Barnabas were ſent, <hi>Acts</hi> xiii. 2. And thoſe by whom Timothy was ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> iv. 14. And as that Maid at leaſt pretended to be, of whom Tertullian <hi>De A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima,</hi> c. ix. Beſides we ſee how often theſe Prophets of the New Teſtament are inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to foretell things to come. And in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:169390:72"/> the Gift of Languages being inſpired both for the ſubject, and the tongue in which it is expreſſed, it is certain, that the Gift of Propheſying is not contained within humane conceptions. And indeed the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſpecified out of the Apoſtle of Edifying, Exhorting, Comforting, of Speaking words of wiſdome and knowledge of myſteries, may well be referred to that rank of inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whereby a man is moved to ſpeak that which the uſe of his humane reaſon inableth him not to conceive, with aſſurance that the motion is from the Holy Ghoſt: which kind of inſpirations are counted Propheſies even among the Ebrew Doctours, as hath been ſaid. And in this kind the Expoſition of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is not without cauſe underſtood under the Gift of Propheſying in this place. The Commentaries intituled to S. Ambroſe, <hi>Prophetas dicit Interpretes Scripturarum. Sicut enim Propheta futur a praedicit, quae neſciuntur, ità &amp; hic, dum Scripturarum ſenſum, qui mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis occultus eſt, manifeſtat, dicitur</hi> PROPHETA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RE. <hi>By Prophets he meaneth Expoſitours of the Scriptures. For as a Prophet foretelleth things to come which are not known; ſo ſuch an one, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting the meaning of the Scripture, which many perceive not, is ſaid to</hi> PROPHESIE. The ſame is to be found again in him and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers divers times, not ſo much becauſe the Apoſtle hath ſpecified here any ſuch part of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:169390:72"/> Prophets office, as becauſe the rules which he preſcribeth in Propheſying afterwards, from <hi>verſ.</hi> 29. do plainly belong to thoſe that had the Scripture in hand to expound, as ſhall appear afterwards. Therefore it is plain that theſe Propheticall inſpirations were ſeen in the Expoſition of Scripture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is that upon which the Apoſtles rule proceedeth, verſ. 30. <hi>If revelation be made to another ſitting by, let the firſt hold his peace:</hi> meaning, that he that was expounding the Scripture ſhould give way to him to whom the truth of it was revealed upon the inſtant of time. But there is ſomething elſe beſides this belonging to the Gift of Propheſying as well as of Languages. For the Apoſtle from <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. here, thus writeth: <hi>If I pray in an unknown tongue, my ſpirit prayeth, but my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is unfruitfull. What is it then? I will pray with my ſpirit, but I will pray with underſtanding alſo. I will ſing with my ſpirit, and I will ſing with underſtanding alſo. Elſe when thou ſhalt bleſſe with the ſpirit, how ſhall he that occupieth the place of the unlearned ſay, Amen, at thy giving of thanks, ſeeing he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth not what thou ſayeſt? For thou verily giveſt thanks well, but the other is not edified.</hi> It is not ſo clear, how the Apoſtle here ſaith, <hi>My ſpirit prayeth, but my underſtanding is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull,</hi> having ſaid afore, <hi>He that ſpeaketh in a tongue edifieth himſelf.</hi> For if he that hath
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:169390:73"/> the Gift profiteth in the underſtanding of the myſteries which the ſpirit ſuggeſteth to him in a ſtrange Language, how is his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding unfruitfull? Therefore S. Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome acknowledging this difficulty, yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that ſome of them which had this Grace, underſtood what they ſaid, others not; for thus he writeth upon theſe words, <hi>He that ſpeaketh in a ſtrange Language edifieth himſelf:</hi>

                  </gap>. <hi>And how if he know not what he ſaith? But thus farre he ſpeaketh of thoſe that underſtand what they ſay, but know not how to expreſſe it to others.</hi> But the words of Theodoret are thus in the Greek of Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menius, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. That is, <hi>He meaneth by</hi> SPIRIT, <hi>the ſpirituall Grace, but by</hi> UNDERSTANDING, <hi>the declaration and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of things that are ſpoken.</hi> By thus expounding the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, is, <hi>I will pray in a meaning underſtood.</hi> Whether
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:169390:73"/> the words will bear this meaning or not, let men of learning judge: The thing is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enough, ſeeing the fault which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle findeth, verſ, 17. is not that a mans ſelf is not edified, but ſaith he, <hi>another is not edified.</hi> And if we follow the intent of the Apoſtle cloſe, it will eaſily appear, that the purpoſe of his ſpeech requireth more then that a man himſelf ſhould underſtand what he ſpeaketh in an unknown tongue, to wit, that his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence alſo ſhould underſtand it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let who will diſpute the proper ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his words (a thing not ſo ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in this place) ſo long as the drift and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the argument guideth and over-ruleth the ſenſe, when he ſaith, <hi>I will pray and ſing with my</hi> SPIRIT, <hi>I will pray alſo and ſing with</hi> UNDERSTANDING, to be this, I will pray and ſing by inſpiration, but it ſhall be in a meaning underſtood, or underſtanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; according to the words of Theodoret alledged afore, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And it followeth thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Now he ſaith, It is fit that he that ſpeaketh in another tongue, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſinging Pſalmes, or Praying, or Teaching ſhould either interpret himſelf (and understand</hi>

                  <hi>what he ſaith) for the benefit of his hearers, or that another ſhould do it, that is ſufficient to be taken for an Aſsiſtant to his Doctrine.</hi> The words incloſed are added by Oecumenius, deſiring to jumble S. Chryſoſtomes Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation and Theodorets into one, which proceed from contrary opinions: for all the reſt beſides thoſe words is extant in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine of Theodoret, who hath delivered the right of the Apoſtles meaning, That it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for him that ſpeaketh tongues to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret, ſuppoſing that he underſtandeth what he ſaith. The ſame ſenſe is expounded by S. Baſil, <hi>Reg. Brev.</hi> 278. otherwiſe the nature of this Branch of the Gift of Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges is truly ſet down by S. Chryſoſtome in theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>For of old there were many that had the Grace of Prayer, with that of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. and they prayed, and the tongue praying ſpake the Perſian or Romane Language, but the mind knew not what was ſaid.</hi> In that he think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that he which had the Gift, underſtood not what he ſaid, I have ſhewed for what cauſe I leave him afore; but in that he ſaith, <hi>They had a Grace of Praying with that of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,</hi> as a branch of it, it ſhall further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear how right he is afterwards. The more I marvell, that the learned Heinſius of late
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:169390:74"/> ſhould ſo diſguiſe the meaning of this whole paſſage, in expounding that appertenance of this Gift of Languages, whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaketh here, verſ. 13. <hi>Wherefore let him that ſpeaketh in an unknown tongue, pray, that he may</hi> INTERPRET. The meaning whereof he maketh this: When a man hath ſpoken in an unknown tongue, let him repeat the ſumme of it in his prayer afterwards, and ſo interpret his meaning in a known Language. Theſe are ſome of his words, <hi>Siquis ergò, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit, linguâ peregrinâ uſus eſt, adjungat preces, quibus antedictainterpretetur. Peregrinâ enim linguâ preces ſi concipiantur, fruſtrà fit hoc cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tè, quia non intelliguntur. If a man have uſed a ſtrange language, ſaith the Apoſtle, let his prayers follow, wherein he may interpret what he ſaid afore. For if prayer be conceived in an unknown tongue, ſure it is to no purpoſe, being not underſtood.</hi> Thus do men ſometimes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their wit and learning to make things obſcure that are plain enough when they are let alone. But though, as he ſaith, it is now in uſe in divers Churches to recapitulate the Sermon in a prayer after it, yet it concerned him to have ſhewed us ſome trace or ſtep of like practice in the writings of the Apoſtles, or Primitive Chriſtians, if he would have us to believe this to be the meaning of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle. Now the Apoſtle, as he ſpeaketh of <hi>praying,</hi> ſo he ſpeaketh of <hi>ſinging,</hi> of <hi>bleſsing,</hi>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:169390:75"/> of <hi>giving thanks</hi> with the Spirit, and with underſtanding: theſe are no dependances of that which was preached afore, therefore neither that Praying whereof he ſpeaketh here. For you heard what Theodoret ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Whether in praying, or in ſinging Pſalms, or in Teaching.</hi> And you ſhall ſee what the Apoſtle ſaith afterwards, verſ. 26, 27. <hi>When ye come together, every one of you hath a Pſalme, hath a Doctrine, hath a Tongue, hath an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation. Let all things be done to edifying. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man ſpeak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the moſt by three, and let one inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret.</hi> Where, as Theodoret hath well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his meaning, that <hi>all things,</hi> as well ſinging of Pſalmes, as teaching matter of Doctrine (and Theodoret had cauſe to adde Praying, finding it afore, verſ. 15.) might be done to the beſt purpoſe of edifying, his will is, that whatſoever is ſpoken in any of thoſe kinds, in a ſtrange Language, be interpreted by one, whether the ſame that ſpoke alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or another that had the Gift to do it. In fine, to make appear that the Apoſtle when he ſaith, verſ. 13. <hi>Let him that ſpeaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may Interpret,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth that he ſhould pray for the Gift of Interpreting that which he was inſpired to ſpeak in a ſtrange Language. It ſhall here be declared that the Apoſtle directeth them to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:169390:75"/> labour after theſe Graces by their Prayers as well as by their Studies, or what means elſe they could addreſſe to God for the attaining of them. That which we ſaw practiſed by the Diſciples of Prophets, under the Old Teſtament, that we ſhall ſee preſcribed by the Apoſtle under the New, when he ſaith, 1. Cor. xii. 31. <hi>But be zealous of the best Gifts.</hi> and 1. Cor. xiiii. 1. <hi>Be Zealous of ſpirituall Gifts.</hi> and again, <hi>Let him that ſpeaketh in an unknown tongue, pray that he may Interpret.</hi> Where S. Chryſoſtome, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Here he ſheweth, that it is in them to receive the Grace. For,</hi> LET HIM PRAY, <hi>ſaith he, that is, Let him contribute that which is required at his hands, for if thou ask ſtudiouſly, thou ſhalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it.</hi> When he expoundeth, <hi>Let him pray,</hi> to be, Let him contribute what is required from him, he meaneth that Zeal and Study which is ſpoken of in the other places, of which you have again, verſ. 39. <hi>Be zealous or ſtudious of Propheſying, and forbid not to ſpeak with Tongues:</hi> and 1. Theſſ. v. 20. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe not Propheſying.</hi> The like you ſhall find in S. Chryſoſtome upon!. <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 31. and the Commentaries under S. Ambroſe his name, upon 1. Cor. xiiii. 32. <hi>The Spirits of the Prophets are ſubject to the Prophets. Idcirco dixit</hi> SUBJECTUS EST PROPHETIS, <hi>ut ingenia</hi>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:169390:76"/> 
                  <hi>accenderet hâc ſpe, quòd Spiritus conatus adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet. Therefore he ſaith</hi> IS SUBjECT TO THE PROPHETS, <hi>to incourage wits, with hope that the Spirit helpeth their endeavours:</hi> And by and by he draweth to this purpoſe the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>For they drank of the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Rock that followed them,</hi> and addeth, <hi>Hoc eſt enim ſubjectum eſſe, quod eſt ſequi. Ità Spiritus Subjectus dicitur, ut conatus bonos adjuvet, cùm perficit. Subjectus enim videtur qui coepta alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius perficit. For to be ſubject, is the ſame as to follow. So the Spirit is ſaid to be Subject, becauſe of his help to good endeavours, when he bringeth them to paſſe. For he that bringeth anothers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings to effect, ſeemeth to be ſubject.</hi> This is not to allow this meaning of the Apoſtles words, which I ſhall ſhew afterwards to be otherwiſe: but to take notice what impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this truth they received from the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces alledged. And you ſhall find the ſame Authours, to let paſſe others, expounding the Apoſtles words <hi>Rom.</hi> xii. 3, 6. no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. <hi>According as God hath dealt to every man the meaſure of Faith, and whether Propheſying according to the proportion of Faith.</hi> S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, <hi>Haec ergò datur pro modo accipientis, hoc eſt, quantum cauſa exigit propter quam datur. This therefore</hi> (that is, Propheſie) <hi>is given ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſure of him that receiveth; that is, as much as the cauſe requireth, in reſpect whereof it is beſtowed.</hi> And S. Chryſoſtome,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:169390:76"/> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>For though it be a Grace, it is not indifferently poured forth. But taking the meaſure from them which receive it, floweth upon them, in meaſure as it findeth the veſſel of faith offered.</hi> underſtanding that faith which moveth men to ſue to God for ſuch Graces, as he ſaith, <hi>pray that he may Interpret.</hi> And this is it which the Apoſtle writeth to Timothy, 1. Tim. iv. 13, 14. <hi>Till I come give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine, neglect not the Gift that is in thee, which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thee by Propheſie, with the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery.</hi> And 2. Tim. 1. 6. <hi>Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou ſtirre up the Gift of God that is in thee, by the putting on of my hands.</hi> For in calling it a <hi>Gift,</hi> he ſignifieth an extraordinary Grace of that time: but in willing him <hi>to ſtirre it up,</hi> and not to neglect it, he ſheweth that it was in him to procure it at Gods hands, by reading, and teaching, and praying, and the like means which he nameth, or nameth not. The true meaning then of the Apoſtle when he ſaith, verſ. 14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my ſpirit prayeth, but my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is unfruitfull. What is it then? I will pray with the ſpirit, but I will pray with the underſtanding alſo: I will ſing with the ſpirit, but I will ſing with the underſtanding alſo: Elſe</hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:169390:77"/> 
                  <hi>when thou ſhalt bleſſe with the ſpirit, how ſhall he that poſſeſſeth the room of the unlearned ſay A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at thy giving of thanks, ſeeing he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth not what thou ſayeſt? For thou verily giveſt thanks well, but the other is not edified:</hi> I ſay the meaning of this whole paſſage ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth that which we began to prove of the Prophets under the Old Teſtament, that it was part of their Office to compoſe the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God, and the prayers of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations. For if we take not our marks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, we ſhall ſee that the ſtrength of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage upon theſe words againſt the Church of Rome lieth in this, becauſe the Apoſtle argueth expreſſely againſt them, that to ſhew their Gift of Languages, took vpon them, not onely to utter the myſteries of God in ſtrange Tongues, but alſo in them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Prayers and Pſalmes of Gods praiſes, in the name and behalf of the Church. This they are deſirous to decline if the Apoſtle would give leave. For that which he ſaith, verſ. 17. ANOTHER <hi>is not edified,</hi> is as much as we find, verſ. v. and verſ. xii. <hi>that the</hi> CHURCH <hi>may be edified.</hi> and verſ. xix. <hi>In the Church I had rather ſpeak five words to teach</hi> OTHERS. and the Apoſtle afterwards, verſ. 16. <hi>What is it then, my brethren, when you come</hi> TOGETHER, <hi>every one of you hath a Pſalme.</hi> And to this purpoſe it will be very effectuall to obſerve, That as in the Old Teſtament,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:169390:77"/> Saul and his ſervant are ſaid to meet a whole Quire of Prophets Propheſying, and the ſonnes of Aſaph, Heman and Jeduthun are ſaid to Propheſie in ſinging the praiſes of God which the ſpirits of Prophets had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited; ſo in the New Teſtament, for the ſame cauſe, it ſeemeth, that ſinging the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God, is called <hi>Propheſying</hi> by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle. For let me ask what the Apoſtle meaneth when he ſaith, 1. Cor. xi. 5. <hi>Every woman praying or</hi> PROPHESYING <hi>with her head uncovered:</hi> his ſpeech concerning Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Aſſemblies, wherein he forbiddeth a woman to ſpeak, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> xiiii. 34? Is it that which the Italian Gloſſe of Diodati after Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za hath expounded? <hi>It ſeemeth,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>this word is to be taken here, not onely for handling or expounding the Myſteries of the word of God, as Rom.</hi> xii. 6. <hi>but alſo for hearing them, mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, meditating upon them while they are propoſed of thoſe that have the Charge.</hi> This cannot be allowed. Praying is the parties own act, why not PROPHESYING, that ſtandeth in rank with it? The Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries under S. Ambroſe his name, <hi>Prophetari autem eſt, adventum fore Domini voce Symboli poſt Orationem effari; To Propheſie is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce in the words of the Creed, that the Lord ſhall come.</hi> The Creed was pronounced by the whole Congregation, this he thinketh was called <hi>Propheſying,</hi> becauſe it ſpeaketh of the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:169390:78"/> coming of Chriſt which ſhall be. I bring not this becauſe I allow it, for it is ſomewhat ſtrange, to make all people Prophets that ſay their Creed, becauſe one Article of it ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of things to come: beſides, I do not find that the Creed was from the beginning any part of the Church-Service. But becauſe he ſaw the true point of the difficulty, that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Propheſies was no Propheſying, but it muſt be ſomething that the Congregation uttereth, as well as in Praying, which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle calleth <hi>Propheſying:</hi> And what doth the whole Congregation ſend forth but Prayers and Pſalmes? In both theſe, as near as can be, the people bear their part: the whole pack of Prophets Propheſied toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when Saul, and his ſervant, and his meſſengers came, becauſe they all joyned in the Praiſes of God, Samuel guiding the Quire: when the Spirit of God came on them, they uttered the Praiſes of God which the Spirit of God ſuggeſted, the reſt bearing part in their ſenſe.

                  <hi>veiled?</hi> here you have the two particulars of Pſalmes and Prayers expreſſed, which the Apoſtle calleth <hi>Praying</hi> and <hi>Propheſying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> with the reaſon, of reverence at the mention of God, to inforce his purpoſe, that they ought not to content themſelves with no veil at Pſalmes, or with a ſlight one at Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. And afterwards, <hi>Oportet ergò omni tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore &amp; omni loco memores Legis incedere, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratas &amp; inſtructas ad omnem Dei mentionem, qui ſi fuerit in pectore cognoſcetur &amp; in capite foeminarum.

And as for the Prayers of the Church, we have a ſingular paſſage in the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 26. to the beſt of my judgement to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to this purpoſe, <hi>And the Spirit alſo helpeth our infirmities, for we know not what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit maketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſsion for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered.</hi> For what is it, that the Apoſtle calls <hi>the firſt fruits of the Spirit,</hi> verſ. 23. there afore, but the flowr &amp; cream of thoſe ſpirituall Graces, whereof the Apoſtle wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all this while to the Corinthians? And when he ſaith, <hi>we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought,</hi> true it is, we are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:169390:79"/> informed, what we are to pray for in the Scripture, but ſeeing the purpoſe of the Scripture in generall, is not ſo perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by all perſons, much leſſe the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igence of it duly pointed in particular, it is no marvel if we believe, that the inſpiration of the holy Ghoſt, is able far better to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, what we are to pray for, even at our Aſſemblies, when we ſee the Apoſtle himſelf pray for the goad in the fleſh to be removed, which God thought not fit to be granted. But when he ſaith, <hi>the Spirit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth interceſsion for us,</hi> we know firſt that by the SPIRIT, the Apoſtle in this ſubject con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually underſtandeth the Inſpirations of it, as hath been obſerved afore: we know again what endleſſe debate &amp; difficulties, the ſenſe of theſe words breedeth, and what better courſe have we to end them, then by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in theſe words, the interceſſions which the holy Ghoſt inſpireth? And thoſe <hi>unutterable groans of the Spirit,</hi> whoſe mind <hi>he that ſearcheth the heart trieth,</hi> verſ. 27. <hi>and findeth that it maketh interceſsion for the Saints, according to God,</hi> what are they elſe, but thoſe deſires, which the Spirit inſpireth to them which have the firſt fruits of it, cauſing them to groan within themſelves, <hi>waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of the body,</hi> as it went afore <hi>verſ.</hi> 13? For as men inſpired were not able to expreſſe the vehemence of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:169390:80"/> the deſires they were inſpired with, no more were they able to comprehend the meaning of them, the depth of things inſpired, being ſounded by him alone that inditeth the ſame. This expoſition is S. Chryſoſtomes, who hath delivered us the ground of it for Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall truth, upon the place, telling us, that there was no leſſe peculiar an inſpiration to pray, at that time, then there was to foretell things to come, to cure diſeaſes, to do mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, to ſpeak ſtrange languages. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>With all theſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>there was alſo a Grace of Prayer, which was alſo called</hi> A SPIRIT (as the ſpirit of knowledge, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of wiſdome, and the like, that is the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Gift of it) <hi>and he that had this, prayed for all the multitude. For becauſe, not knowing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe things that are good for us, we deſire thoſe that are not,</hi> (as here it is ſaid, We know not what to ask for as we ought) <hi>the grace of Prayer came upon ſome man then, and he ſtood up to deſire in the name of all, that which was good for the Church in Common, and taught others to do it.</hi> And again, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. <hi>For he that was vouchſafed this Grace, ſtanding with much compunction, with many groans, ſuch as proſtrate a man in mind before God, asketh ſuch things as are good for all. Correſpondent whereto now is the Deacon, when he offereth to God the prayers for the people.</hi> The opinion and relation of this moſt excellent man at expounding the Scripture, going ſo clear with the words of the Apoſtle, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this beyond queſtion with me, to be the meaning of the Apoſtle. which ſhall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards get ſtill more credit, by the profer which ſhall be made, of deſigning the kind and nature of theſe Prayers and Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaketh here, to have been the ſame that the Church hath practiſed in all Ages ſince. And, theſe things ſuppoſed, the meaning of the Apoſtle in the paſſage which we are in hand with ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſheweth, that as theſe which were indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the grace of Languages, did not ſtick to do thoſe things, to utter the praiſes of God, the prayers and thankſgiving of the people, at their Aſſemblies, in unknown tongues, to make ſhow of their Gift which he forbiddeth: ſo thoſe that had the Grace of Propheſying, did and are directed to do the like for the benefit of the Congregation, in all particulars whereof he ſpeaketh. Theſe things thus cleared, give us full aſſurance of the kindred between theſe two kinds of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:169390:81"/> Graces, of Languages and Propheſying, by the limbes and branches of the offices ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from both: and that by conſequence, all theſe Propheticall Graces, were of imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate inſpiration, as much as that of Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. which the Apoſtle coming up to his firſt purpoſe in this whole diſcourſe, which was to regulate the uſe of both kinds of theſe Graces at their Aſſemblies, further declareth in recapitulating thoſe Offices of both, <hi>verſ.</hi> 27. which he thinketh fit to remember there. His words are theſe, verſ. 26. <hi>How is it then brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a Pſalme, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation: Let all things be done to edifying.</hi> Tongues and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations of them, it is plain, belong to none but thoſe that have that Grace: Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations are ſpecified afore to be a kind of Propheſying, but there is no reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince that they might not be ſuggeſted in ſtrange languages. Pſalmes it is plain by that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> went afore, were uttered in ſtrange languages, but the Apoſtle preſcribeth to do it in the known tongue, as an office of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying. Of Doctrines the like muſt be ſaid as of Revelations. In fine, the reaſon which moves the Apoſtle to allow ſpeaking in ſtrange tongues in the Church, provided there be one to interpret, becauſe the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſo uttered are for the edifying of it, is
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:169390:81"/> enough to prove that the ſubſtance of things uttered by both Graces, was not unlike; &amp; therefore thoſe rules alſo, in which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle concludeth, ſerve to averre the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and agreement obſerved between the two kinds of Graces, ſpeaking as they do to two heads, one of Languages, the other of Propheſying. The ſumme of them being the ſame that was propoſed in the beginning of the chapter: for there we reade, <hi>deſire ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall gifts, but rather that ye may Propheſie;</hi> and here in the concluſion we reade, verſ. 39. <hi>covet to Propheſie, and forbid not to ſpeak with Tongues.</hi> Commending the one without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, permitting the other with a caveat of one to interpret. The ſame is the meaning of his rule to the Theſſalonians, 1. v. 19, 20. <hi>Quench not the ſpirit, deſpiſe not Propheſying.</hi> The one part adviſing to maintain all ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Graces, by allowing the orderly uſe of them at their aſſemblies; the other in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to eſteem aright of Propheſying above the reſt, which the Apoſtle expreſſeth in terms of abatement, charging not to deſpiſe it. Before I take in hand the meaning of theſe rules in particular, be it obſerved, that theſe things which were delivered at their aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, in the uſe of both kinds of Graces, were not conceived upon the inſtant, but ready provided afore: for within theſe terms the Apoſtles words will conclude us, when
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:169390:82"/> he ſaith, verſ. 26. <hi>When ye come together every one of you</hi> HATH <hi>a Pſalme,</hi> &amp;c. which is, that they came provided of what they intended there to declare, as appeareth by that part of the rule that concerneth Propheſying verſ. 29, 30. <hi>Let the Prophets ſpeak two or three, and let the other judge: if revelation be made to another that ſitteth by, let the firſt hold his peace.</hi> Where the difference is manifeſt, between that which was ſuggeſted at the inſtant, and that which was conceived afore. Now whereas the principle upon which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle proceedeth is the edification of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as he ſaith, verſ. 26. <hi>Let all be done to edifying;</hi> well are we aſſured that it was for the edification of the Church, to underſtand what the Spirit ſuggeſted to them that ſpake in ſtrange languages, concerning the praiſes of God and the myſteries of his kingdome. It was for their edification indeed, but not ſo much as the knowledge of the Scripture, which conſiſteth not of Revelation for the time, but is intended for the perpetuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Gods people. Therefore the Apoſtles will is, that two or three ſpeak with tongues, and another interpret, not to take up that time which the expoſition of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture required, verſ. 27. S. Ambroſe upon thoſe words, <hi>Ideo ut multum tres &amp; Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem illorum, nè occuparent diem Linguis loquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, &amp; non haberent tempus Prophètae diſſerendi</hi>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:169390:82"/> 
                  <hi>Scripturas, qui ſunt totius Eccleſiae illuminato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. Therefore three at the moſt, and him that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreteth them, that they ſhould not ſpend the day in ſpeaking Languages, ſo that the Prophets which are the inlightners of the whole Church, ſhould not have time to expound the Scriptures.</hi> The holy Ghoſt was diſpenced among men that were converted to the faith, for their aſſiſtance in underſtanding the Scriptures, which alwayes was their buſines. They began ſtraight, as the uſe was under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to train others to the ſame knowledge. The Apoſtles rule ſuppoſeth no leſſe, ver. 29, 30. <hi>Let the Prophets ſpeak two or three, &amp; let the other judge. If revelation be made to one that ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth by, let the firſt hold his peace.</hi> The whole words of S. Ambroſe touched afore; <hi>Haec Traditio eſt Synagogae quam nos vult ſectari (quia Chriſtianis ſcribit, ſed ex Gentibus factis, non ex Judaeis) ut ſedentes diſputent, Seniores dignitate in cathedris, ſequentes in ſubſelliis, noviſsimi in pavimento ſuper mattas: Quibus ſirevelatum fuerit, dandum locum dicendi prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipit, nec deſpiciendos quia membra Corporis ſunt: It is a Tradition of the Synagogue which he would have us to follow (for he writeth to Chriſtians, but converted, not from the Jews, but from the Gentiles) to diſpute ſitting, the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest in dignity in Chairs, the next on ſeats, the laſt on matted floores. To whom if Revelation were made, he commandeth that room to ſpeak be</hi>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:169390:83"/> 
                  <hi>allowed, not deſpiſing them as members of the body.</hi> The inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt was not alwayes preſent with Prophets, they ſpake in Expoſition of the Scripture, out of that which the Spirit formerly had ſuggeſted. Moſt like it is that the inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Holy Ghoſt ſhould poſſeſſe one or other of them which had the Grace, in the time and place of Divine Service: for you ſaw afore verſ. 24. how the revelation of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets was wont to be infuſed upon them at that time when unbelievers came into their Aſſemblies. If any ſuch thing came to paſſe, the Apoſtles will is, though he were of a mean rank among the Diſciples of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, he ſhould be allowed to ſpeak. For let no man think that the Apoſtle here alloweth all members of the Church to ſpeak in publick. In that the pretended S. Ambroſe ſeemeth to miſtake, admitting thoſe, whom he deſcribeth ſitting on the floore, to ſpeak. For he that was inſpired without peradventure ſate not upon the floore, but among the Prophets. The words of the Apoſtle are generall, when he ſaith, verſ. 31. <hi>For ye may all Propheſie one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.</hi> But this ſpeech all this while concerneth not the Congregation, but thoſe that have the Gifts of Propheſying and ſpeaking with Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. And men of Learning know, that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:169390:83"/> words are to be confined to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Argument of the ſpeech. Beſides, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle hath made the difference himſelf, when he ſaith, verſ. 16. <hi>How ſhall he that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupieth the room of the unlearned ſay Amen at thy giving of thanks?</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he that ſitteth in the place of a private perſon without Learning, is ſo named in difference to thoſe that profeſſed themſelves Teachers; if he ſhould ſtand up and teach, this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which the Apoſtle maketh would be quite aboliſhed. He forbiddeth a woman to ſpeak in the Church whatſoever be her Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, were ſhe one of Philips daughters the Propheteſſes, he alloweth not all men to ſpeak, but ſuch whoſe Graces were known and diſcerned, of whom all the Diſcourſe hitherto proceedeth. Now the matter in queſtion is this: It is plain that the Gift of Languages came by immediate inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt: and it is plain that many particulars of the Gift of Propheſying did likewiſe, as the foretelling of things to come called <hi>Propheſying,</hi> verſ. 6. the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of mens ſecrets, the underſtanding of the Scripture, and of matters debated upon it, verſ. 25. and 30. the Praiſes of God and the Prayers of the Congregation, which were inſpired in ſtrange Languages, as it is ſaid, verſ. 14. <hi>My ſpirit prayeth, but my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is unfruitfull;</hi> and therefore were no
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:169390:84"/> leſſe inſpired to them of whom the Apoſtle, verſ. 15. <hi>I will pray and ſing with the Spirit, and with underſtanding.</hi> In fine, there is no cauſe to make doubt, that all the particulars, through this whole Chapter, ranged under the generall Grace of Propheſying, are by him underſtood to proceed from men indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with immediate inſpirations. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the queſtion wil be, What is his meaning in that which followeth, verſ. 32. <hi>The Spirits of the Prophets are ſubject to the Prophets;</hi> for on the one ſide, when he ſaith, <hi>The Spirits of the Prophets,</hi> the word SPIRITS in this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject hath alwayes ſignified inſpirations, true or pretended: on the other ſide, the inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Holy Ghoſt are not to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, are not to be judged, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 29. though it be by Prophets. The meaning of theſe words give me leave thus to debate. S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe thinketh, that when it is ſaid, <hi>The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Prophets are ſubject to the Prophets,</hi> a reaſon is given for the Rule which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth to ſpeak by turns, and to give way to him that is inſpired upon the inſtant, <hi>verſ.</hi> 29, and 30. to ſhew that this they might well do, becauſe they were not ſo inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt, as to be tranſported to ſpeak whether they would or not, but that it was in them to moderate, as it was in them to procure the influence of it, according to his words produced afore. In this ſenſe, the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:169390:84"/> Spirits of Prophets are ſubject to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets themſelves. But though we grant, that mens particular indeavours were means to attain the Grace of immediate inſpirations, as was proved, yet we are not therefore bound to grant, that it was in them to be inſpired at their pleaſure. In the Old Teſtament it is ſaid, <hi>That the Spirit of the Lord</hi> CAME <hi>upon Saul and his ſervants:</hi> and Jer. xlii. 7. <hi>After ten dayes the word of the Lord</hi> CAME <hi>to Jeremiah,</hi> having undertaken to pray for the revealing of the will of God to them before: from whence the Ebrew Doctours collect, that he could not obtain the Grace in the mean time: <hi>Maimoni Fundam. Legis</hi> viii. 5. and the late Annotations there. Beſides, this ſenſe is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to the Apoſtles purpoſe; who when he ſaith, verſ. 29. <hi>Let the Prophets ſpeak two or three, and let the others judge,</hi> ſpeaketh of things brought from home, and conceived afore the time of meeting, as you may ſee verſ. 26. <hi>When you come together every one of you hath a Pſalme,</hi> and ſo forth. But when he ſaith, verſ. 30. <hi>If revelation be made to another as he ſitteth, let the firſt hold his peace,</hi> he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of that which is inſpired at the inſtant of time. And therefore it ſeemeth more reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to conceive, that the Apoſtle, when he ſaith, verſ. 31. <hi>ye may all Propheſie one by one,</hi> rendereth a reaſon for what he had ſaid in commanding them to ſpeak by turns, that
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:169390:85"/> all might contribute to the edification of the Church, as it followeth there, <hi>That all may learn, and all may be comforted:</hi> But when he addeth, <hi>And the Spirits of the Prophets are ſubject to the Prophets,</hi> he rendereth a reaſon for what he ſaid in command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the other to judge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe if ſome ſhould not yield to the judgement of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the confuſion and unquietneſſe enſuing hereupon might be imputed to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God. Theodoret, after S. Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome; <hi>Ità Jeſus ſubjiciebatur Moſi, ità Elizae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Eliae, ità ipſi Elizaeo multitudo Prophetarum, ità ipſi Apoſtolo Timotheus &amp; Titus &amp; reliqui. So was Joſue ſubject to Moſes, ſo Elizeus to Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, ſo a number of Prophets to Elizeus, ſo Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus, Titus, and the reſt, to the Apoſtle.</hi> And this ſenſe Calvine embraceth. According to which, the judgement whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, if we conceive it to concern imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate inſpirations, muſt not be underſtood to call them to account, as for the truth of that which the Holy Ghoſt inditeth, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in judging the meaning and conſequence of things inſpired, which even the perſons from whom they came, though not ignorant throughout, as not bereft of their ſenſes and underſtanding in Propheſying, yet were not able themſelves to ſound to the bottome. Do we not ſee the Prophet Daniel, ix. 2. ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying about the ſeventy years which the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:169390:85"/> Prophet Jeremiah had foretold, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations of Jeruſalem, whereupon he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and obtaineth the Revelation of the ſeventy weeks? And the Apoſtle, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 10, 11. expreſſely affirmeth that the ancient Prophets, who Propheſied of Salvation by Chriſt, ſearched and enquired diligently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, and the time of it, whereof the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit within them Propheſied. And to ſhew that it was no otherwiſe with them that were endued with like ſpirituall Graces under the New Teſtament, it is to be obſerved with what earneſt obteſtations the Apoſtle deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with the Theſſalonians, 2. <hi>Ep.</hi> ii. 1, 2. not to be troubled as if the day of Chriſt were at hand, either by SPIRIT, or by word, or by letter as from us. For if the Spirit ſpake it, how are they otherwiſe to be perſwaded? Is it becauſe the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended inſpirations? So it is ſaid indeed, but them he had inſtructed them to diſcern, 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> v. 21. How then ſhall we think that the Apoſtle beſeecheth them not to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with that which the Spirit ſpake, but as it might be a meaning collected out of words ſpoken by ſome man that had ſuch Graces? And therefore in 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> iiii. 1. the Apoſtle thus writeth, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>The Spirit ſpeaketh</hi> EXPRESSELY, ſaith the Apoſtle, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that a different thing from the meaning apprehended, or collected from things which
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:169390:86"/> the Spirit ſpake. And to my apprehenſion we have an eminent inſtance hereof in the Apoſtle himſelf, who having had a Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Acts</hi> xix. by which he purpoſed in the Spirit when he had paſſed through Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia and Achaia, to go to Jeruſalem, ſaying, <hi>After I have been there, I muſt alſo ſee Rome;</hi> under this reſolution writeth to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes in that Epiſtle, dated not long after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, xv. 23. <hi>That he had now no place in thoſe parts:</hi> and to the Elders of Epheſus not long after that thus ſpeaketh, Acts xx. 25. <hi>I know that ye all among whom I have gone, preaching the kingdome of God, ſhall ſee my face no more.</hi> All which nevertheleſſe, being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards at Rome, he writeth to the Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians from thence, ii. 24. <hi>That he hopeth to come to them ſhortly.</hi> And to Philemon, in the parts of Aſia, about the ſame time, verſ. 22. <hi>To prepare him a lodging, as hoping to be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them through their prayers:</hi> Things which can no wayes ſtand with that which he had written afore, that he had no longer place in thoſe parts; and that the Epheſians ſhould ſee him no more: and all this, no more inconvenience in the Apoſtle then this, that upon his Revelation he conceived God had appointed that, which afterwards upon the ſucceſſe of his affairs, he was in hope would come to paſſe otherwiſe: Nor more inconvenience that this ſhould be rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:169390:86"/> in Scripture, then that the ſpeeches of Jobs friends ſhould have a place in it, of whom it is ſaid, <hi>They have not ſpoken aright of me as my ſervant Job hath done.</hi> Thus then, when the Apoſtle willeth the others to judge of that which two or three Prophets ſhall ſay, as he appointeth at their meetings, his meaning is, not onely of that which by the way of common reaſon and ordinary skill ſhall be ſaid in Expoſition of the Scripture; but even thoſe things which are ſpoken by inſpiration, which he calleth <hi>the Spirits of the Prophets,</hi> he will have ſubject to the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Prophets, ſo farre as concerneth the meaning and conſequence of them, to be meaſured by the reſt of the Scriptures. And to this purpoſe it ſeemeth he ordereth the uſe of thoſe ſpirituall Graces which are poured upon this Church of Corinth in ſuch abundance, that it was hard to find a courſe for all of them to imploy their Gifts ſo, that all might have opportunity by turns, if not at the ſame meeting, to uſe their Grace in Propheſying, that the Church might be edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by it; and that others might by the Gift of diſcerning ſpirits judge the meaning of thoſe things that were ſpoken by the Spirit, ſo that the Church might receive no ſuch offenſe, as that which the Theſſalonians did, in conceiving from things that were ſpoken by the Spirit, that the day of the Lord was
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:169390:87"/> at hand at that time. Though it is neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to be thought that this courſe, of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by many at the ſame Aſſembly, was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in the Synagogue, eſpecially when di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Scribes and Doctours were preſent; as alſo ſome traces of the ſame cuſtome have continued in the practice of the Church.

               <p>THus farre then have we travelled in the firſt part of our buſineſſe propounded, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring the Apoſtles meaning in this whole diſcourſe, intended to regulate the uſe of ſpirituall Graces proper to that time, in their Aſſemblies, by comparing the particulars of it, with that which is found remembred in the Scriptures to the like purpoſe. How wide ſoever theſe things may be thought from my intent, as having nothing to do with the particulars, which the Apoſtle here order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, to me it ſhall ſeem a great gain, for the pains beſtowed here, that from hence we may collect the ſubſtance of thoſe things which are to be done at the Religious Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of Chriſtians, the particulars of that work for which we Aſſemble our ſelves; which are no other according to the Apoſtle then our Common Service expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:169390:89"/> in the entrance to it, <hi>To ſet forth his moſt worthy Praiſe, to heare his moſt holy Word,</hi> (which muſt be underſtood according to the purpoſe and opportunities of ſeverall Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, either read or expounded, as the meaning of it hath alwayes been declared by practice) <hi>and to ask thoſe things which be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and neceſſary, as well for the body, as the ſoul.</hi> The ſame hath Tertullian expreſſed to have been the buſineſſe of the Primitive Chriſtians at their Aſſemblies. De Anim. c. ix. <hi>Jam verò, prout Scripturae leguntur, aut Pſalmi canuntur, aut Adlocutiones proferuntur, aut Petitiones dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tur, ità indè materiae viſionibus ſubminiſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. Now, as the Scriptures are read, or Pſalmes ſung, or Exhortations produced, or Prayers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, ſo is matter miniſtred to her viſions.</hi> In his Apologetick, c. 39. and in Juſtine Martyr his ſecond Apologie, where they deſcribe to the Powers of the Empire what the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans did at their Aſſemblies, of ſinging Pſalmes there is no remembrance, the reſt are the ſame particulars. There can be no queſtion made that their practice was deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Apoſtles, when we conſider how much this Diſcourſe of the Apoſtle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth, in which we have ſeen the Pſalmes and the Prayers which thoſe that were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with ſpirituall Graces compoſed and conceived on the behalf of the Church, as hath been ſhewed: where nevertheleſſe he
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:169390:89"/> hath expreſſed the part that particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons bear, when he ſaith, <hi>Every man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Praying or Propheſying,</hi> that is, ſinging of Pſalmes, as hath been declared afore. In like ſort, whatſoever Rules he giveth to order the courſe of Propheſying among them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from ſuppoſition of reading the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures afore, to the Expoſition whereof he willeth them to contribute the fruit of their Graces. And this in the firſt place I make account to be gained without contradiction from this Diſcourſe of the Apoſtle, That all theſe are ſubſtantiall parts of that work, for which we go to Church; all of them Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipals, none of them acceſſories in it. The ſetting forth of Gods praiſes in Pſalmes of Thankſgiving you ſhall ſee to be that part of morall and perpetuall Service, the Order whereof is moſt particularly remembred in the Old Teſtament in Solomons Temple. As the Sacrifice was burning upon the Altar, and the Wine-offering pouring out on it, and the Prieſts blowing with the Trumpets in the Court of the Sanctuary, which was their Ceremoniall and Figurative Service, in the mean time, the Levites ſtood upon their Pulpits in the outer Courts where the men or women of Iſrael were licenced to come, ſinging the Pſalmes of Gods praiſes. Times of their Aſſemblies were preſcribed by the Law of Moſes, as you have ſeen, but no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:169390:90"/> for any particular work of ſpirituall Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to be performed at them, is there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred. Not to make a doubt that other Offices were frequented, together with the Expoſition of the Law, as the cuſtome and opportunitie ſerved; but to ſhew, that the Pſalmes of Gods praiſes, for the ordinary daily practice whereof ſuch expreſſe Order was taken and remembred, muſt by no means be reckoned of the by, but of the main of Gods Publick Service. And if we ſhould go further to ſhew that this was no perſonall ſervice of the Levites alone, but of the whole congregation of Gods people aſſembled there; and that it is ſo acceptable with God in this regard, becauſe his praiſe appeareth more glorious, when his people joyn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſetting it forth, we might produce a great part of the book of Pſalmes, wherein David and other perſons inſpired by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt have either expreſſed, or ſtirred up the affections of the whole congregation to that work, and recommended the Service of God which it yieldeth. Pſalm. xxxiv. 3. <hi>O magnifie the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name</hi> TOGETHER. cxlix. 1. <hi>O ſing unto the Lord a new ſong, and his praiſe in the</hi> CONGREGA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION <hi>of the Saints.</hi> lxxxiv. 4. <hi>Bleſſed are they that dwell in thine houſe, they will be ſtill prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thee.</hi> He commendeth the condition of Prieſts and Levites, but he deſireth as farre
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:169390:90"/> as he can to make it his own, cxvii. when he ſingeth, <hi>O praiſe God all ye People, praiſe him all ye Nations.</hi> The Apoſtle ſheweth us that this is accompliſhed when the Gentiles ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves to the Church, <hi>Rom.</hi> xv. 11. and ſo is all the reſt of like nature, Pſalm. c. 4. <hi>O go your way into his gates with Thankſgiving, and into his courts with Praiſe, be thankfull un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him and bleſſe his Name.</hi> But ſhall we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that theſe things are accompliſhed in merely believing the Goſpel, or in ſerving him according to it, as they are required to do in the Scriptures that foreſaw it? In fine, S. Auguſtine hath inſtructed us, that the Pſalmes are to be underſtood in the perſon of David, or him that compoſed them by the Holy Ghoſt, in the firſt place; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, they belong to the perſon of Chriſt firſt, and then to his myſticall body the Church: So, whatſoever is there read in the ſingular number, hath the laſt reſort of the meaning in the congregation of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: But thoſe things that are couched in the plurall number there cannot properly be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to proceed from particular perſons; every <hi>Praiſe ye,</hi> every <hi>Hallelujah</hi> is owned of none but Aſſemblies. Beſides, it expreſſeth to us the intereſſe which the honour of God hath in every thing of this nature that is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick. Could it be ſuppoſed, that the ſame thing were done, the ſame praiſes yielded to
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:169390:91"/> God by each man in private, which all men yield him in common, there is no Chriſtian that is ſenſible of the body of Chriſt, and the fellowſhip of all members of it, could think theſe to be both one to Gods Service, becauſe the Spirit that maketh this body one, requireth of each member of it a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular influence in the common Office. Hearts indued with ſeverall Graces to God, are like ſeverall voices to the eare. But we are farre from ſuppoſing this: Many men may think that they need not go to Church for thoſe Offices which they do at home: But they ought to think what the common ſort of Chriſtians might do, if Aſſemblies were not held: As the matter is, the Service which the beſt are able to yield unto God, is much improved by joyning with the reſt of his members, but ſhould we not Aſſemble for that purpoſe, the hearts of plain ſimple members, which now are moſt acceptable to God, would be able to move little in this work, the Order of the Congregation not guiding them in it. Laſt of all, be it conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that this is the imployment of the other world: when mens deſires are all ſatisfied, and all the ſubject of prayers poſſeſſed, the Angels, the Elders about the Throne of God, and all the people of Jews and Gentiles which encompaſſe it, <hi>Revel.</hi> vii. 9. ceaſe not to joyn in the praiſes of God, when the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:169390:91"/> Church is become perfectly one. As for the Prayers of Chriſtian Aſſemblies, we know upon what Patent they ſtand. Matth. xviii. 19, 20. <hi>Again I ſay unto you, that if two of you ſhall agree on earth as touching any thing they ſhall ask, it ſhall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. For where two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I in the midſt of them.</hi> And we know that all Service of God at that time had reference to the Temple at Jeruſalem, which reference our Lord abrogateth in his ſpeech with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritane, <hi>John</hi> iv. 21. 23. ſubſtituting the worſhip of God in Spirit and Truth, in ſtead of the Ceremoniall worſhip of the Temple, upon which all depended at that time. We muſt know further, that by the Rules of the Synagogue, under ten that are of years there is no Congregation. Before that number of ſuch as are come to years be preſent, they go not to Prayers: But our Lord, intending to free his Church of all Rules that might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge the Priviledges of it, knowing that occaſions might fall out to diminiſh the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his people that deſired to Aſſemble, aſſureth them of his preſence in the midſt of them, where the leaſt number agree in the things which they deſire at his hands. But if the reaſon of his preſence among them be their agreement in their deſires, then two or three that agree in their deſires, with oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:169390:92"/> to the reſt of the Congregation, ſhall not be heard; but if they agree with the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, then muſt they, &amp; will they, Aſſemble with it to obtain their deſires at Gods hands. The Apoſtle, 1. Tim. ii. 8. <hi>I will therefore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that men pray every where, lifting up pure hands without wrath or diſputing.</hi> Beza there, <hi>His verbis tollitur Hieroſoly mitani Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli circumſtantia legalis: Et iſta reſpondent verbis Mal.</hi> i. 2. <hi>Joan.</hi> iv. 21. <hi>Omnem ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men locum intellige ſacris coetibus deſtinatum. Agit enim Paulus de publicis precibus in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muni conventu, ut in toto orbe terrarum pura haec ſacrificia Deo offerantur, de quibus apud Malachiam agitur. Theſe words,</hi> in every place, <hi>take away the legall circumſtance of the Temple at Jeruſalem. And this agreeth with the words Mal.</hi> i. 2. <hi>Joan.</hi> iv. 21. <hi>But under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand every place, of ſuch as are appointed for holy Aſſemblies. For Paul ſpeaketh of Common Prayers at publick meetings, that thoſe pure ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, of which the Prophet Malachi ſpeaketh, be offered to God all over the world.</hi> When the Apoſtle forbiddeth wrath, and diſputing in their Prayers, it is plain enough his meaning is of their Aſſemblies, the fruit whereof he would not have intercepted through their diſſentions. A ſtrange thing that men ſhould ſo forget the Communion of Saints, as to think of the Publick Prayers of the Church no otherwiſe, then of thoſe which they
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:169390:92"/> know they can make at home: As who ſhould ſay that the incenſe of the Temple which the Pſalme ſpeaketh of, cxli. 2. <hi>Let my Prayer be directed before thee as the incenſe,</hi> made no other perfume, then the ſpices would do were they burnt one by one. <hi>Coi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus ad Deum ut quaſi manufactâ precationibus ambiamus. Haec vis Deo grata eſt</hi> Tertull. Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loget. c. 39. <hi>We make a riot upon God, as if we ſued by ſtrong hand with our Prayers. This vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence is welcome to God.</hi> He that is earneſtly deſirous to obtain thoſe things which the Church prayeth for at Gods hands, will think his pains well beſtowed to joyn ſo much ſtrength to his ſuit, as the favour of the Congregation with God affords. The Jews have an opinion that the Prayers of the Congregation are alwayes heard: not ſo the Prayers of particular perſons in private. Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moni of Prayer <hi>c.</hi> viii. <hi>num.</hi> 1. They have deſerved to void the truth of this opinion, as for the favourable part of it, but the promiſe of our Lord hath inlarged it to us. Again, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>And alwayes,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>let a man go morning and evening to the Synagogue, for his prayer is not heard alwayes but in the Synagogue: and he that dwelleth in a city where there is a Synagogue and prayeth not there with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, this is he that is called a</hi> BAD NEIGHBOUR.

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:169390:93"/> prayers the ſtrength of his own; but himſelf findeth the fruit of his own bad neighbour-hood, when his own prayers want the aſſiſtance of his neighbours. The Church is one in faith, and one in love, to this purpoſe, that all that hold the unitie of it, may find the ſtrength of the whole, in the effect of their own prayers. This is that <hi>one ſhoulder,</hi> and that <hi>one lip</hi> of the Prophet Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaniah, one ſhoulder to croud into Gods ſervice, one lip to praiſe him with. This is that <hi>Mountain of God</hi> in the Prophet Iſaiah, unto which he foretelleth that all nations ſhould flow: whereupon the Rule of the Jews is, to runne to the Synagogue, but to come eaſily from thence, Maimoni c. viii. n. 2. <gap reason="foreign">

Neither is it to be thought, that the publick ſervice of the Church can ſtand without reading the Scriptures, how eaſie ſoever ſome men ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it is to do it at home. Firſt, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Morall and not Ceremoniall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in Synagogues, it hath appeared, that it was wont to be read there as the ſubject for thoſe ſpeeches that followed for the expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it: we know we have the Law of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes diſtinguiſhed into diviſions, anſwerable to the number of weeks in the year, that it
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:169390:93"/> might begin and end with it: and you ſhall find afterwards an Order of reading the Law in publick as ancient as Nehemiahs time. The leſſons of the Prophets, corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent to theſe, how ancient ſoever they be (Elias the Levite deriveth them from the time of Antiochus Epiphanes, as if the Jews began to practiſe them, when he had forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den them to reade the Law of Moſes) we know our Lord Chriſt took one of them for the ſubject of his ſermon at Nazareth, as his Apoſtle ſtood up at Antiochia <hi>after the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Law and the Prophets.</hi> Certain it is, that from hence hath been continued the cuſtome of Leſſons of the Old and New Teſtament in the Church to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Juſtin Martyr in his ſecond Apology. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>On the day called Sunday all that abide in towns or the countreys about meet in one place, and the records of the Apoſtles, or the writings of the Prophets are read, as far as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſerveth. Then the Reader having done, the Preſiaent in a ſpeech inſtructeth, and exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the imitation of ſuch excellent things.</hi> The words have a place here, becauſe the Authour is ſo ancient: otherwiſe the matter
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:169390:94"/> is plain enough, were it but from that we had in the Conſtitutions of the Apoſtles, for no queſtion the cuſtome hath been very ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, to begin the ſermon when the Leſſons of the Epiſtles and Goſpels were done. And hereupon it is that Preachers, among the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Church writers, are called <hi>Tractatores,</hi> and <hi>Tractare,</hi> to preach, and S. Auguſtines expoſition upon S. John is called <hi>Tractatus,</hi> becauſe it was preached to the people. All this, becauſe they handled the Scriptures which were read. And Optatus charging the Donatiſts and Parmenians, that their faſhion was to leave the expoſition of their Texts, the Leſſons read, to fall on railing upon the Catholicks, lib. iv. <hi>Nullus veſtrûm qui non aliud initiet, aliud explicet: Lectiones Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas incipitis, &amp; Tractatus vestros ad injurias noſtras explicatis: Profertis Evangelium &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citis abſenti fratri convicium. There is none of you,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>but beginneth one thing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth another: Ye begin with the Leſſons of the Lord, but ye purſue your Tractates to our wrong: Ye produce the Goſpel, but ye revile your brother in his abſence.</hi> Hereupon the name of <hi>Tractatores</hi> ſtandeth ſometime in oppoſition to <hi>Canonici</hi> &amp; <hi>Authentici;</hi> to preſerve the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the authority of Scripture, and whatſoever words it is expounded with. A difference not to be ſmothered between the Scripture and the beſt expoſition of it
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:169390:94"/> that a man can imagine. There is one thing that hindereth the effect of the Scripture when it is read, that is, becauſe it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. Thereupon cometh the office of Preaching in the Church, to expound the word of God; and that which is preached hath the force and virtue of the Word of God, becauſe the Word of God is not the letters and ſyllables, but the ſenſe and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scriptures. But all men are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable more or leſſe of underſtanding the Scriptures as they are read: And no man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth them ſo well, but may improve by hearing them read in the Church. Let thoſe that ſlight this part of the Church-ſervice take order firſt, that all Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhall be perfect in the knowledge of the Scriptures. And yet were that come to paſſe, we muſt not give way to leave it out: The better they are acquainted with it, the more ſhall they improve in the underſtanding of it, by hearing it repeated. But ſo farre as it is underſtood, it is a thing ſtrange and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that any man living ſhould imagine, that the effect thereof, in inlightning the mind, or converting the heart, is leſſe when it is read, then when it is expounded out of the pulpit. The one the word of God, as the holy Ghoſt inſpired it, the other no leſſe, ſo farre as it departeth not from that which is written, but alwayes ſubject, ſo long as man
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:169390:95"/> is ſubject to errour and miſtake, to depart from it. And when this precious wine is once daſhed with the water of humane ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, it is no offenſe to me that it is ſtill called the <hi>Word of God;</hi> for ſo it ſhould be, and ſo it is preſumed to be, till it appear otherwiſe: but it will concern every man to look about him, that he pin not on God his own infirmities. As for the neceſſity and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of preaching, let all them that are moſt affected to it examine their reaſons, and they ſhall not aſcribe more to it, then here ſhall be done. Here, if any where, that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference hath place, which Divines make of things neceſſary to ſalvation: ſome as <hi>means,</hi> without which it cannot be had in any caſe; others as things <hi>commanded</hi> to be done, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it is not to be had for thoſe that are under that Command and do them not. He that in his ripe years hath learned ſo much of the Chriſtian faith, as to be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the means of our reconcilement to God, and that condition of life which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, believing the one, and ſubmitting to the other, and deſiring his baptiſme in conſequence. As he that was baptized an infant, and when he cometh to years of knowledge doeth the like, as it concerneth his caſe to do, what wanteth ſuch a man to ſet him in the ſtate of Salvation, that can be counted neceſſary MEANS of it? what ſhould
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:169390:95"/> hinder him with old Simeon to ſing his <hi>Nunc dimittis,</hi> ſhould it pleaſe God to take him in that eſtate? But becauſe that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of life, which Chriſtians undertake, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth to do all things out of obedience to the will of God, and with intention of his honour and ſervice, therefore thoſe things which in the latitude of their kind and nature are neceſſary but as things commanded to be done, become neceſſary as means of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to thoſe that are under that command. He that by his own fault is ignorant of that which it concerneth him to believe, or to do for the diſcharge of his profeſſion to God: He that ſuffereth himſelf to be abuſed, to be diverted and led aſide by the deceits of the world, and his corrupt inclinations, for want of that warning and adviſe, whereof God appointeth him the means: he muſt needs fail of his profeſſion to God, in fulfilling whereof the means of ſalvation conſiſteth: but he muſt take it upon his own account, that he faileth of it. Upon theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we are to value the neceſſitie of Preaching, in reſpect of particular perſons. Upon theſe conſiderations we are to value, how much it muſt needs concern all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Common-wealths, to furniſh the means; all Chriſtian Churches, to take order that it may be done. As the means to bring men to know, as the means to move men to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:169390:96"/> thoſe means, without which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaved: As the means to inſtruct them more and more, to guide them from time to time, in a ſtraight courſe both of their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and doings. Theſe conſiderations not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, if the queſtion be made, Which is the chief work for which Chriſtians Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble, to heare the Scriptures expounded by Preaching, or to ſerve God in their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. There is a viſible advantage due to this latter, becauſe it is a means nearer the end of both. It cannot be denied that all Preaching is to the purpoſe of informing the mind, or moving the heart to deſire that which is good indeed: But Prayer being the actuall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of it, is the exerciſe of the means which God ordaineth to procure it. But otherwiſe, if we compare the work of Miniſtring the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Church, w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> that of Miniſtring the Doctrine of the Scripture, upon the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations premiſed, it muſt be affirmed, that Preaching is the chief work which the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Church from their office are able to contribute towards the publick ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God. Becauſe the other part of it may be Miniſtred to the ſame purpoſe by men of common ſenſe, whereas this requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth thoſe perſonall abilities which all men have not. For one may be the mouth of the Congregation in Prayer, to as good purpoſe in all regards, in following a preſcript form, as exerciſing his wit and underſtanding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:169390:96"/> it, (ſuppoſe this for the preſent which ſhall be proved afterwards) and therefore we ſee in the Primitive Church, moſt parts of the Service were referred to inferiour Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. They had ſuch as read the Leſſons, ſuch as ſung the Pſalmes, and a great part of the Prayers were done by Deacons. And though many men are ſo eager to have all Miniſters to be the mouth of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in conceiving Prayers at the inſtant; yet no man ſhall perſwade me that their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, to place the beſt of their performance, either in the conceptions or in the language wherein they expreſſe the deſires thereof to God, for theſe ſure make no difference to him, ſo their be no offenſe. The beſt they can contribute is the devotion of the heart which they pray with, wherein they are but one of the Congregation: the meaneſt of it may bring as good as they are able to do. But in Preaching, a mans knowledge in the Scriptures, his abilities to expreſſe his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to the capacitie of his Audience, his diſcretion in addreſſing it to their particular without offenſe will either be ſeen, or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And therefore, whoſoever commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the price and value of the work, for due reaſons, muſt needs call to mind how diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult it is. For he that cometh to expound the Scripture to the people, muſt underſtand it aright before he cometh to expound it, and that underſtanding cometh not in theſe dayes
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:169390:97"/> by the immediate inſpiration of the Spirit, but is allotted to humane indeavours, in theſe that in the fear of God take pains about the means which he hath provided for it. And in delivering no more then a mans knowledge, there fall out many times theſe failings, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> like Eli's ſonnes may make the Offering of God to be loathed, and the Miniſtrie of God contemptible. And though all Scripture, as ſaith the Apoſtle, 1. Tim. iii. 15. <hi>is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in Righteouſneſſe,</hi> yet may all this be ſo unſeaſonably miniſtred, that the effect may prove offenſe, though the end be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment. It cannot be ſaid with juſtice, that this truth is acknowledged here, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the eſteem of this work, which tendeth indeed to inhance the diligence of them which do it. But this muſt be averred, that unleſſe men and abilities be provided for the work, as well as the work for them, it may prove a ſword in a blind mans hand, to wound the Church as well as the enemies of it. Though all that hitherto hath been ſaid, to the nature and uſe of theſe particulars of Publick ſervice, pretendeth to ſhew no more but this, that they are all principals and ſubſtantials, no acceſſories in it. That the praiſe of God in Pſalmes, the reading of the Scriptures, is not, by the nature of the work, and the Primitive Cuſtome of the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:169390:97"/> Church, to while out the time till the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation be aſſembled: That the prayers of the Church, are not in the main intent of them, to uſher in the Sermon, or to leave im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of it in mens minds afterwards, but for the procuring of all neceſſaries of the Congregation, and each particular of it, ſo farre as generall order can compriſe. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto hath nothing been ſaid of the chief part of Publick Service among Chriſtians, that is, of Celebrating and receiving the Lords Supper: the Euchariſt, which from the beginning of the Profeſſion and Name of Chriſtians, was frequented as the chief part of Publick Service in moſt of their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, now, becauſe it is not of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall uſe, is not mentioned among the reſt, at the beginning of our Service. For the preſent I preſſe no more but the words of the Apoſtle, as they ſeem to be expounded by a paſſage of Ignatius, to ſhew what effect the prayers of the Congregation have in the Conſecration of that Sacrament, and the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of it. For it is a fearfull word of the Apoſtle, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 20, 21. where having charged the diviſions among them, to be the cauſe that their Aſſemblies were not for the better but for the worſe, he proceedeth thus, <hi>When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lords Supper: For in eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every one taketh before other his own ſupper:</hi>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:169390:98"/> 
                  <hi>and one is hungry, and another is drunken.</hi> It is plain it was the Lords Supper they intended to celebrate, therefore, if they received it not through their own fault, it muſt needs be ſacriledge on their hands. The fault is plain enough, as well neglect of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, out of the ſchiſmes that were among them, as their exceſſe in particular. Take the words of Ignatius to expound the Apoſtle, they are the words of one that drank at his ſpring, and ſpake to the ſame purpoſe, Epiſt. ad Epheſ. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Let no man be deceived, if a man be not within the Altar, he cometh ſhort of the bread of God. He that is within the Altar,</hi> with Ignatius, is he that communicateth with the Church: in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe under the Law that feaſted upon the reliques of Peace-offerings, to which the Love-feaſts of Chriſtians uſed with the Euchariſt, practiſed correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. There was one Altar from whence all men communicated of thoſe Sacrifices; which thoſe that forſake, ſaith Ignatius, may take upon them to celebrate the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, but the bread they receive is not the Lords, it is profane. To the ſame purpoſe, Ep. ad Smyrn. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Let that be counted a firm Euchariſt which is held under the Biſhop, or him to whom he committeth it.</hi>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:169390:98"/> The celebration of the Euchariſt is not ſound, nor effectuall but under the Biſhop, that is, in the unitie of the Church, therefore ſacriledge in them that attempt it. His rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is to our purpoſe, for if the prayer of one or two have that force, ſaith he, that God ſtandeth in the midſt of them, how much more ſhall the Prayer wherein the Biſhop and Church agreeth prevail? That Prayer wherein they agree prevaileth to make the Sacrament the bread of God, to them that agree in it, therefore that, wherein they agree not leaveth it as it was no bread of God, but the ſubject of their Sacriledge. If this be not enough to inforce the virtue of publick Prayers, nothing will ſerve the turn. It is the agreement of the Congregation in their Prayers, that maketh the Elements, the Supper of the Lord with S. Paul; the bread of God with Ignatius, to them that agree: thoſe that agree not fail of the Grace, fail not of committing ſacriledge. Having thus farre derived the ſubſtance of that which is to be done at Chriſtian Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, from the practice of the Apoſtles themſelves, and after them of the Primitive Chriſtians, it will be requiſite before we go further, upon the preſident of their practice, to conſider the weight and extent of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, upon which the Apoſtle proceedeth, in ordering the manner of performing the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:169390:99"/> particulars, whereof hitherto hath been ſaid among the Corinthians: The chief whereof is the edification of Gods people, upon which he pitcheth the iſſue of his foregoing diſpute, <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. which may ſeem to extend no further then the information of the mind and underſtanding, in matters of Religion belonging to knowledge; becauſe the ſpeech of the Apoſtle proceedeth concerning the uſe of ſpirituall Graces, which he directeth to that purpoſe: As you ſee, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely differenced from matter of exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and comfort, when he ſaith, <hi>He that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſieth, ſpeaketh to men to</hi> EDIFICATION, <hi>and exhortation, and comfort.</hi> Nevertheleſſe it muſt be ſomething elſe that he meaneth there, verſ. 17. <hi>For thou verily giveſt thanks well, but the other is not edified:</hi> that is, becauſe he underſtandeth not what thou ſayeſt, he is not guided and directed to go along with the Thankſgiving wherein thou goeſt afore in an unknown Language. And in this Epiſtle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, viii. 10. <hi>Shall not the conſcience of him that is weak, be edified to eat thoſe things which be offered to Idoles?</hi> Where you ſee a man is ſaid to be EDIFIED by whatſoever it is that advanceth his intentions towards any work. And therefore, though the reaſon of EDIFY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING may ſometimes tend to the particular ſenſe of Teaching, yet it is not ſo to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, but that, whatſoever is a fit means to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:169390:99"/> train and guide us in the wayes of godlineſſe, muſt be ſaid to tend towards the edification of Gods people. And thus, the Rules which the Apoſtle afterwards qualifieth all that is to be done in the Church with, when he ſaith, <hi>Let all things be done decently, and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> are clearly ſubordinate to this main rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Edification of the Church, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from it. For, without doubt, there is nothing ſo powerfull to Edification, that is, to guide and train the body of the Church in the exerciſe of godlineſſe, as a good Order for the particular practice of thoſe Offices thereof which are generally commanded in the Scriptures. Well might the Apoſtles ſay here, verſ. 33. <hi>God is not the Authour of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion but of Order, as in all Churches of the Saints.</hi> Whoſoever withdraweth himſelf from the publick Order of the Church, out of opinion that a better might be eſtabliſhed, will hinder the Edification thereof more in that neglect of the courſe in force which he procureth, then it is poſſible he ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance it in the practice of thoſe whom he thinketh to direct in a better courſe. For on the one ſide, his own followers, out of heat of contention, ſhall alwayes ſpend their zeal upon matters of ſmall conſequence, which ought to be converſant about the great things of the Goſpel: On the other ſide, thoſe that are not affected with his ſingulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:169390:100"/> are diſquieted in their own courſe of Gods Service. The other part of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Rule ſeemeth to extend further then the term of <hi>Decencie,</hi> in which it is tranſlated, containeth, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>honeſtè</hi> ſaith the Old Latine, and in S. Pauls Epiſtles <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is rendered there <hi>honeſtè ambulare,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in the Acts, <hi>honeſtae mulieres,</hi> all theſe expreſſe more then Decencie. For that is ſeen in the leaſt matters, where all things are fit and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, but that which in Latine is called <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtas,</hi> in none but thoſe that carry an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance that deſerveth reſpect. Which if the property of the word will not inforce, as to them that relliſh it right without fail it will do, the nature and kind of that whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, will conſtrain it to import no leſſe then that which beareth an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of reſpect and account: Becauſe in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſo high a nature, as the exerciſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, nothing can be decent, nothing can become, but that which preſerveth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect which actions of that rank are to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with. So much common ſenſe tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us, that the outward appearance of all kind of proceedings, is a means to maintain the inward eſteem which men ought to hold of thoſe things that are done there. Let no man blame me that appeal to common ſenſe to judge what becometh in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:169390:100"/> which muſt neither ſtand nor fall by the judgement of common ſenſe, being ſo farre beyond it. The Apoſtle here hath done it afore me, verſ. 23. <hi>If the Church be met, and all ſpeak with tongues, and there come in thoſe that are unlearned or unbelievers, will they not ſay that ye are mad?</hi> For what is this, but to condemne that which they did in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Religion, by the verdict of common ſenſe, which though unable to judge of the Religion of Chriſtians, nevertheleſſe is able to diſcern what is ſutable to the end which the Aſſemblies of Chriſtians profeſſe? And do we not all ſee with what kind of reaſons in another place, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 13. he argueth another point of this nature, to ſettle a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome for men to be bare, women to be veil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at their Aſſemblies? It is firſt to be known, that the women of thoſe times, and of the Jews in particular, as Tertullian in one place witneſſeth, were carefull to keep their faces veiled from the ſight of men, when they came in publick; which was in them a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of baſhfulneſſe, and that modeſty which they deſired to preſerve. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, in men it was a mark of confuſion and diſgrace to have the face covered: the cuſtome was to go bare in publick, and that in token of the freedome and boldneſſe which they profeſſed. And it is plain, that the Covering, whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaketh,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:169390:101"/> was ſuch an one as the face was veiled with: for therefore he ſaith, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. The man diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoureth his head, in covering it when he prayeth or propheſieth, diſclaiming the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and dignity of his ſexe: The woman in diſcovering her head, not profeſſing the modeſty and ſubjection of her ſexe: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaith afterwards, that the womans hair is given her for a veil, that is to cover the face with, which if it be not done, ſhe had as good be ſhaven, ſaith he, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. In Tertullians time, thoſe that profeſſed Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, took upon them to ſit with their faces unveiled in the Church, taking it for a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their rank, to diſclaim the ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſexe, and profeſſe freedome. This is the occaſion of his book, <hi>De Virginibus velandis.</hi> What opinion it was, upon which the cuſtome which the Apoſtle writeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt at Corinth proceeded, is not known. How the Apoſtle argueth we ſee, 1. Cor. xi. 13. <hi>Judge in your ſelves,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered? doth not even nature it ſelf teach you,</hi> &amp;c? To ſhew us the reaſon whereupon he proceedeth, that the cuſtome then practiſed, for men to go bare-head in ſigne of freedome and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of boldneſſe and chearfulneſſe of heart, women veiled in ſigne of modeſty and baſhfulneſſe, as it was agreeable to revealed truth, as the Apoſtle diſputeth before, <hi>verſ.</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:169390:101"/> 3, 7. which teacheth that the woman was created of the man, and muſt not forget the ſubjection ſhe oweth him from whom ſhe firſt came; ſo is it to the light of nature, that teacheth women to keep their hair to veil themſelves with; if there be nothing elſe to do it with, men to part with theirs, that it hinder not their boldneſſe to appear: As <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tul. Apolog. c.</hi> xxx. ſaith, They prayed bare-headed, becauſe not aſhamed. By which it remaineth undeniable, how much the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle referreth to common reaſon, to judge of the fitneſſe of thoſe things that are practiſed at our Religious Aſſemblies, when he ſetteth aſide his Apoſtolick Authority, to conſult with their common ſenſe about matters to be ordered. But when that is done, having alledged how agreeable the cuſtome for which he pleaded was, both to the light of nature, and to revealed truth; becauſe it is not poſſible that matters of this nature ſhould be put paſt contradiction and diſpute, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining reaſons iſſuing from the mere na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things, and yet the quiet of the Church, on which the Edification of it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth, requireth that they ſhould be out of diſpute: you ſhall ſee where the laſt reſort of his plea endeth, when he ſaith, verſ. 16. <hi>But if any man ſeem to be contentious, we have no ſuch cuſtome, neither the Churches of God.</hi> where he hath eſtated a generall Rule for the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:169390:102"/> Church to follow, that in matters of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference, the cuſtome of the Church is to be preferred before our own reaſons. The indifference whereof here we ſpeak, is not to be found in the action to be done or not to be done, as if in things of this ſlight nature our obligation to God had no influence, as if it were indifferent to a man to do or not to do, to do this or the other: but the indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whereof we ſpeak, is to be underſtood in the latitude and kind of the thing preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to be done or not done, which indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is taken away by cuſtome accruing. For example, when S. Auguſtine ſaith, <hi>Ep.</hi> cxviii. that to faſt on Saturday or not, to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the Euchariſt, or to communicate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day or not, were things of free obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance; his meaning was not, that it was free for particular perſons to do what they would, without reſpect to the cuſtome in which they lived; that is quite againſt the purpoſe of his Epiſtle, which is for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of preſent cuſtomes: but that of their own nature and kind they were free to be determined by the practice of ſeverall Churches, which he that regardeth not in his particular, is the cauſe of an offenſe. It is no more then the Apoſtle teacheth, when he ſaith, <hi>If any man ſeem to be contentious, we have no ſuch cuſtome, neither the Churches of God.</hi> Where he acknowledgeth, that in
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:169390:102"/> things of this nature, even his own reaſons, for the cuſtome in force, muſt needs be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to contradiction of contrary reaſons, much more, other mens reaſons, for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of like nature, might be oppoſed with ſuch as might move men to think the contrary cuſtome better, for which they plead: and yet concluding, that they ought to ſubmit their reaſons to the cuſtome in force, hath given us authority to conclude, That men are bound, in matter of that nature, to balk their private judgement, to proceed upon publick cuſtome. The reaſon being that which was argued afore, becauſe cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome containeth Order, and upon Order the edification of the Church dependeth: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can private Innovations, in the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage which they yield, beyond that which is received, countervail the diſadvantage of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick confuſion and unquietneſſe, which they cauſe. There are beſides theſe which have been diſcourſed two conſiderations of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular moment to recommend and to inforce the Orders of Publick Service. For as the Church univerſall is but one in regard of times, as well as of places and countreys, thoſe Orders muſt needs appear moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, which are derived from the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall practice of the Ancient Church, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially next the Apoſtles: And as the Church is at this time incorporate into the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:169390:103"/> State of Kingdomes and Common-wealths, it is the ſecular Arm that eſtabliſheth it with a power that is able to conſtrain, but when that is done, there muſt needs accrue a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond obligation of obedience for conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which the Apoſtle requireth to be yielded to ſecular Powers. It is not my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to oblige the Church of this time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce into practice all things which a man may find to have been practiſed even in the time of the Apoſtles, much leſſe afterwards: We have divers remarkable inſtances, of matters allowed, and appointed by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in Scripture, which are come to disuſe upon appearance that the reaſon is ceaſed whereupon they were preſcribed. Such is that whereof I ſpake even now, for women to be veiled on their faces, in the time of Publick Service, which the Apoſtle infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth with ſo many reaſons, and yet among us doth not take place, neither in the reſt of countreys, where it was never the cuſtome for women to go abroad with their faces co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, in ſigne of the modeſtie and ſubjection which they profeſſe. Such is that Ancient Cuſtome of Agapae, or Feaſts of Love, the Originall whereof S. Chryſoſtome truly deriveth from the manner of living of thoſe Primitive Chriſtians that made all things common, in the Acts of the Apoſtles. There were thoſe in other places that went not ſo
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:169390:103"/> farre, yet intended to preſerve ſome impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their practice: Theſe, upon ſet dayes of Aſſemblies, furniſhed a common enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment both for rich and poore, ſo that, Service being done, after the Communion of the Myſteries, they went all to feaſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the rich providing and inviting the poore, and all together making good chear. This is his diſcourſe, in 1. <hi>ad Cor. Hom.</hi> xxvii. neither was it any part of the Apoſtles mind, to forbid this courſe, but rather to allow it, ſo farre as he regulateth and ordereth the courſe of it. Which nevertheleſſe we ſee it is ſo loſt, as if there had never been remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of any ſuch thing in Scripture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it appeareth to common reaſon, that it cannot be practiſed to the ſame purpoſe, now that all the world is Chriſtian, as it was when they were tied ſo ſtrait together by the Profeſſion that differenced them from the Gentiles. And ſuch is that Order of the Apoſtle concerning Gentiles converted to the Faith, Acts xv. 29. <hi>To abſtain from meats offered to Idoles, and from bloud, and from things ſtrangled:</hi> The reaſon where of being nothing but this, when it is examined to the bottome, that the Jews converted to the Faith, might find leſſe offenſe in matters of daily practice, which their Orders impoſed upon them, but the Gentiles made no ſcruple at, and ſo might the better piece into one
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:169390:104"/> houſhold of the Church; it is no marvell if the obſervance of it came afterward to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe when the reaſon had ceaſed. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is remarkable even in S. Auguſtines time, as we find, <hi>cont. Fauſt. l.</hi> xxxii. 15. that divers Chriſtians then ſcrupled at the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this obſervance, in eating of a Hare killed by breaking the neck, or ſmall Fowl without letting bloud, which he that doth, ſaith he, is now laughed at for his pains of the reſt; becauſe it could not appear to one ſo ſoon as the reſt, that the ground of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction was ceaſed. If then ſuch Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Cuſtomes as are allowed and injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Apoſtles themſelves are with right aboliſhed, becauſe the reaſon of them is ceaſed, much more thoſe, which were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up at the beginning upon humane ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of the Church, may ceaſe when the reaſon of that good appeareth not, and muſt ceaſe when evil conſequences, which they draw into the Church at their heels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to appear. This is that which juſtifieth the Reformation which we profeſſe, wherein ſome obſervances in the Church, as ancient as there is remembrance in it of things uſed ſince the time of the Apoſtles, are perhaps aboliſhed by Law, or disuſed by Cuſtome; the remembrance of the dead at the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Euchariſt, for example: The reaſon of edification of the Church, by the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:169390:104"/> comfort which it receiveth at the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion profeſſed with the deceaſed, not being now required in particular, by them which preſume of it, in all that dye in the Faith; and the abuſes, which it hath trained in after it, appearing unſufferable. But all this being granted, the conſideration of the Primitive Church, and the Preſident of it, to my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, preſcribeth two things: The firſt is generall: as it is a Church, and all Churches make one Church by acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging and maintaining Union and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Churches that have been in other ages, as well as with the Churches that are in other Countreys, we are obliged not to diſclaim, not to renounce it, but to maintain our ſelves alwayes of Communion with it, without ſubſtantiall difference of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief or practice. The Donatiſts in old time, as S. Auguſtine chargeth, fell foul upon the Article of the Catholick Church, becauſe they acknowledged no Church but their own, but thought it had failed in all other Countreys, by communicating with the Church of Africk, from which they had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated themſelves: Much more foul muſt he needs fall upon that Article, that thinketh the Church periſhed almoſt as ſoon as it was inſtituted, and proceedeth in his practice, as obliged to renounce that which was in the firſt ages. To maintain this Communion, it is
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:169390:105"/> not requiſite we commend, but it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry we tolerate all that was then in practice: though we believe ſome things may be mended at this time, we muſt not believe any thing was pernicious at that time. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in the height, concerneth them which ſeparate from this Church: Let them adviſe upon what terms they renounce that Church which communicateth with the Primitive Church, with which all Churches are bound to hold correſpondence; but in a lower de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree concerneth all thoſe that think they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deteſt the corruptions of the Church of Rome enough, till they involve the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, and whatſoever is done upon the Preſident of it, in the ſame imputations w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ſtick upon it: which is, out of indiſcreet zeal to our own cauſe, to prevaricate againſt it, and for the blindneſſe of the love we bear it, to overſee the advantages of it. For what greater pleaſure can we do the Church of Rome, then to quit them the Ancient Church as their clear advantage? Or what greater ſcandall can we faſten upon the Reformation which we love, then to make every thing we like not a mark of Antichriſt, for which we hold our ſelves bound to ſeparate? which if we ſhould do upon no other matters, then thoſe which ſome men will have to be ſuch, then were we as true ſchiſmaticks as they of the Church of Rome would have us. The
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:169390:105"/> ſecond is an advantage more particular to the point we are in hand with. As it was the Church Primitive, near the fountain, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented that fire the Holy Ghoſt had inſpired ſo late, that which diſcourſe of reaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth to be for the Edification of the Church in the Service of God, muſt needs appear more reaſonable, if it were then in practice. Were the queſtion about matters difficult and obſcure in the meaning of the Scriptures, knowledge goeth along with gray hairs, and it is to be believed that the Church may improve in it, as in time: But whereas it was ſaid afore, that we are to uſe our common reaſon in judging what is for the Edification of the Church in the Order of Publick Service, it is not to be thought that theſe are matters that require ſo much depth of underſtanding, as they do upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of diſpoſition, to give ſentence without inclination or prejudice. I ſay then, that when the coaſt was clear of partialities, the matters in hand not controverted on any ſide, the Church bent more to act in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, then to diſpute about it, the practice of that time may be a way too ſteep for us to tread, but ſure it is ſtraight to direct us. We muſt not ſlight thoſe Orders which directed them to make the Service of God their earneſt buſineſſe, becauſe the Church of Rome hath made it a formall imployment
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:169390:106"/> to paſſe the time over with. If in weeding this Garden of Gods Church we pluck up wholeſome Ordinances with the abuſes which have been pinned to them, well may men deviſe Laws for a good fenſe, but not to much purpoſe, when Religion is not ſuffered to grow within the Pale. That noble and learned Du Pleſſis thought it a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the cauſe he undertook againſt the Maſſe, if he could demonſtrate the Form of Service uſed in the Reformed Churches of France, to be more agreeable to that of the Primitive Church, then that of the Maſſe-book of Rome. This he thought worth his pains to undertake, and if we regard the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Publick Service, may well be thought to have performed it. I am yet in a more generall point, concerning the Order of Publick Service, but I ſhall think it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage enough to the cauſe, in which I deal, to ſhew the points queſtioned in this Order to be of more Ancient Practice in the Church, then the corruptions of the Church of Rome, for which we leave it. And when I come anon to ſurvay the particular Form of Service which this Church uſeth, let men of learning judge what is nearer to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive then both; but thereupon I muſt take leave to conclude, That this Church is not to forſake the Primitive to conform to other Reformed Churches, where the Order in
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:169390:106"/> force hath both the Preſident of ſo Ancient Practice, and the reaſon of Edification to commend it. Now the difference between this State of the Church, incorporate into the bodies of Kingdomes and Common-wealths, and the Primitive, when it was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tolerated or perſecuted under the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire, is to be ſeen in the Apoſtles fiſhing after the Reſurrection of Chriſt, John xxii. 11. <hi>Though there were taken</hi> 153. <hi>great fiſhes, yet the Net brake not. For the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of believers were of one heart, and one ſoul,</hi> Acts iiii. 32. They came out of good will into the Net of the Apoſtles, and out of good will they applied themſelves to the Orders, wherein they were directed by them and their ſucceſſours, not able to conſtrain obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; ſo the Net was not ſtrong enough to hold them, and yet brake not. But when the world came into the Church, then was the Parable of our Lord more clearly fulfilled, which reſembleth the Goſpel to a Net, which drew to the land both good and bad fiſh, and when the Net is not ſtrengthened by the ſecular Arm, no marvell to ſee it break in pieces. It is therefore requiſite, that the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Publick Service have the force of Temporall Laws, by Act of Kingdomes and Common-wealths; but it is nevertheleſſe requiſite, that it ſhould be directed by the Office of Miniſters of the Church, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:169390:107"/> then it was before the Empire or any Common-wealth received the Faith. The charge of directing belongeth to the one which cannot be diſpoſſeſſed of it, the power of conſtraining belongeth to the other which muſt give account how they uſe it or not. Heb. xiii. 17. <hi>Obey them that have the Rule over you,</hi> or guide you, <hi>and ſubmit your ſelves: for they watch for your ſouls as they that muſt give account.</hi> 1. Theſſ. v. 12, 13. <hi>And we beſeech you, Brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord; and to eſteem them very highly in love for their works ſake.</hi> What can theſe Exhortations and Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Apoſtle concern, if in matters ſo proper to their charge, as the Publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God and the Order of it, thoſe of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaketh are not to direct but to execute? And when thoſe diſorders fell among the Corinthians in their Feaſts of Love, and receiving the Myſteries, in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, praiſing God, and preaching in unknown Languages, no doubt through thoſe partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Presbyters, the Ordinary Guides of the Church there, where of hath been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken elſewhere; the Apoſtle indeed himſelf taketh Order in his time, but in caſe the like fall out afterwards, hath he not authorized the Ordinary Miniſteries of the Church, by his example, to take Order in like matters? And when he writeth to Timothy, 1. Tim.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:169390:107"/> ii. 1. <hi>I will therefore that firſt of all ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, prayers, interceſsions, and giving of thanks be made for all men:</hi> wherein without perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture he taketh order for the ſubſtance of Publick Prayer for their Aſſemblies, as ſhall appear, is it his purpoſe to referre the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it to the Congregation there, or to his Office whom he inchargeth with it? It is to be ſeen indeed how much King David did in ordering the Publick courſe of Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in his time: But it is to be conſidered how he proceeded in it, by that which we reade, 1. Chron. xv. 16, 17. <hi>And David ſpake to the chief of the Levites, to appoint their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren ſingers with inſtruments of muſick, pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, and harps, and cymbals, ſounding by lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the voice with joy. And the Levites ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Heman and the reſt:</hi> which is the very courſe by which we pretend ſuch things are to paſſe. But in the Church of Chriſt, as from the beginning things came to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in the Service of God, by Order of the Miniſters and conſent of the people; ſo when Emperours, Kingdomes, and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths received the Faith, they purchaſed themſelves no right of diſpoſing in ſuch matters, as by the Scriptures belong to the Miniſters charge, but they impoſe upon themſelves the charge of inforcing theſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which ſhall ſeem to be for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of godlineſſe. And therefore upon the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:169390:108"/> judgement of diſcretion, common to all Chriſtians, they are to proceed in denying or inforcing the execution of that which is directed by them whoſe charge it concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. If they proceed further, they are to anſwer for the good aſwell as for the wrong which they do, ſo farre as that which is done for the better, as it advanceth the publick good in the particular ſubſtance of that which is done, ſo it may prejudice it more, in the conſequence of the Example. Let us then recollect from the firſt to the laſt, what hath been ſaid, of the reaſons and grounds whereupon the Apoſtle proceedeth in regulating matters concerning the Publick ſervice of God, and we ſhall find that the Church in all ages is to proceed no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Firſt, the edification of the Church, that is, the inſtruction of Gods people in the knowledge of him, &amp; the training of them in the exerciſe of godlines, is the aim propoſed. This is procured by obſerving Order and Comelineſſe in all things to be done, of that nature. The beſt and moſt unpartiall reaſon is to be imployed in judging what beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh in matters of this weight: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not poſſible to put theſe Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces paſt contradiction of oppoſite reaſons, the cuſtome directed by the Miniſters of the Church, upon adviſe of common reaſon, and moſt primitive and univerſall Preſident
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:169390:108"/> of the Church, and inforced by the ſecular Arm, is to take place for Order ſake. If after all this a queſtion be made, Whether matters eſtabliſhed with a tolerable reſpect to the Fiduciall Line of this Rule, oblige men in conſcience to obſerve them or not, he ſhall leave the Church obnoxious to perpetuall confuſion, by neceſſary conſequence, ſeeing it is not poſſible that all men ſhould agree, of their free accord to obſerve any courſe as fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to be obſerved, unleſſe they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves tied in conſcience to obſerve that Rule, which for the latitude and kind of it is not ſinfull for themſelves to obſerve, and that if they fail, they may be conſtrained to it, becauſe it is eſtabliſhed. Poſſible it is that men proceeding in the form of this Rule, ſhould ſo farre miſtake themſelves, as to injoyn the Church to violate ſome of Gods Laws in obeying theirs: in ſuch, a man is bound with his bloud to maintain his diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. But our ſpeech concerneth mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of indifference, where the perpetuall Law of God and Nature forbiddeth not the whole kind and latitude of the thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, where no perpetuall Law of God or Nature, no poſitive conſtitution of God or man, that ought to take place afore this, cometh between; if the Laws of the Church, ſtrengthened by the ſecular Arm, bind not a man in conſcience by virtue of that Law of
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:169390:109"/> God, that inforceth obedience to their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, to do according to them, then muſt all men be at their freedome, to diſſolve or preſerve order in the Service of God as they pleaſe. Where nothing but cuſtome of the Church, upon probable reaſon, directeth our practice, we muſt not proceed according to our private reaſons, which perſwade the contrary; but according to publick cuſtome, if we will be ruled by the Apoſtle: But where there is Law to conſtrain us, we may perhaps have reaſon to think, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours of Laws might have done better, in ordering matters otherwiſe, and yet be bound our ſelves to follow the courſe which they preſcribe. They are to anſwer for the things they injoyn; we for our performance; when was any humane Law made that could not be faulted? if our obedience be delayed till it find ſuch laws as no fault can be found with, the world muſt end in confuſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we practiſe that virtue. It is never law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to do any thing that is evil; but it is not evil, but neceſſary, in the ſphere of things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, to follow the Law that ſtandeth, though a better might ſtand in ſtead of it. Herewith agreeth the judgement of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall reformed Divines, themſelves chief Reformers, which my deſire is to repeat here, though it hath been produced more at large, not as pretending to ſtand or fall
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:169390:109"/> by pluralitie of voices, but deſiring to make it appear, that nothing is ſaid here to croſſe the Principles of the Reformation and chief Reformers. Philip. loco de Caerem. in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia, p. 651. <hi>In Eccleſiis emendatis reliqui ſunt ritus aliqui adiaphori, quia hujus vitae actiones ordine aliquo diſtribuendae ſunt.

That whith Paul requireth, that all things be done decently and in order, is not to be obtained, unleſſe that Order and Comelineſſe ſtand upon ſome obſervances, added as bonds, to wit, to inforce it.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe a little afore, <hi>Si in rebus agendis vigere ſemper ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quem ritum oportet, quem non reſpui publicae honeſt at is interſit, at que adeò humanitatis ipſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us: id in Eccleſiis praeſertim obſervandum, quae cum bene compoſita omnium conſtitutione optimè ſuſtinentur, tum verò ſine concordia nullae ſunt prorſus.</hi> And a little after he toucheth the

But there being ſo much difference in mens manners, ſo much diverſitie of minds, ſo much contrariety of judgements and diſpoſitions, neither is any Common-wealth firm as it ſhould be, till it be ſettled with certain Laws, neither can any rite be obſerved, without ſome ſettled form.</hi> Rites preſcribed by God, cannot be obſerved but according to Forms preſcribed by man.

Before we come to touch that particular form of Service which we uſe, with theſe Rules, let us make triall of them in ſome particulars, which in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall point of publick Service are or may be queſtionable. And that by the method al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſet on foot of Reaſons drawn from the grounds and rules of the Apoſtle, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by the practice of the Primitive, the judgement and agreement of Reformed Churches. Among w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> there is none of more account then this, Whether there ought to be a ſet Form of Prayer preſcribed for our Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies. For it is not denied, that their ought to be an order preſcribed for Publick Service in the whole: but Publick Prayers, and the form of them, it is pretended, are to be referred to the diſcretion of the perſon by whom they are miniſtred, by virtue of that charge of the Apoſtle, wherein he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth to <hi>Quench the Spirit,</hi> 1. Theſ. v. 19. which is conceived to be done, when the conceptions of mens minds, or the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of their tongues, are ſtinted to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed forms, and men by that means ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, that they cannot make demonſtration of thoſe graces which the Spirit of God hath indued them with. This is, to my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:169390:111"/> the beſt of that Argument, that caſteth ſo much and ſo dangerous ſcruple in a clear buſineſſe. And at a diſtance carrieth an appearance of the Word of God, and the meaning of Scripture, but ſurvayed near hand, may be a warning to all men, how they trouble the Church with misapprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, received upon the ſuperficiall ſound of the words of it. For when the Apoſtle for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth to <hi>Quench the Spirit,</hi> he ſpeaketh of immediate inſpirations of the holy Ghoſt, ſuch as they were, by which men were ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to diſcern the ſecrets of other mens hearts. As in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> xiv. 24. by which the Prophets of Antiochia were informed of the will of God, for the ſending of Paul and Barnabas: And thoſe others for the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Timothy, <hi>Act.</hi> xiii. 2. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> iv. 14. by which the truth was revealed unto them, as concerning matters in hand at their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> xiv. 30. And the Rule of the Apoſtle, <hi>If Revelation be made to another as he ſitteth, let the first be ſilent,</hi> is to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, of not Quenching theſe inſpirations. Which, as it hath been ſhowed, that they were maintained by the exerciſe of them, ſo it is no marvel if the Apoſtle be earneſt to have them by all means maintained, becauſe in them conſiſted the Edification of the Church at that time. Therefore he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, that when immediate revelation is
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:169390:112"/> made to one, he that ſpake afore be ſilent: not to demonſtrate what the Spirit of God was able to do, in the perſon by whom it ſpeaketh. That is a miſtake which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth the whole diſpute of the Apoſtle, in the xii. <hi>chapter</hi> afore (for it tendeth to the admiration of thoſe perſons which are indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch Graces; the thing the Apoſtle laboureth againſt through that whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.) But becauſe by them, the preſence of the holy Ghoſt in the Church was evidenced to unbelievers, and confirmed to believers: And becauſe, by ſuch inſpirations, when it pleaſed God to ſend them, the Church was informed of all things contained in them, in the particulars of the true ſenſe of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, debated in their Congregations. In fine, <hi>Quench not the Spirit,</hi> in regard of the Church, is the ſame with the propoſition of this xiv. chap. <hi>Be zealous of ſpirituall Graces, eſpecially of Propheſying:</hi> which is alſo the concluſion of the ſame, verſ. 39. <hi>Be zealous of Propheſying, but forbid not to ſpeak with Tongues.</hi> He that hath the Grace quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, when he purſueth it not by thoſe means, which were effectuall towards it at that time: and the Church quencheth it, if they allow not the publiſhing of ſuch inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations at their Aſſemblies. For my part, I am confident, that the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Quench not the Spirit,</hi> relate as well to the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:169390:112"/> gift of Languages, as his words in this xiv. chap. verſ. 1. <hi>Be zealous of ſpirituall Graces, eſpecially of Propheſying.</hi> For Propheſying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing excepted, the reſt of ſpirituall Graces is the gift of Languages, and it concerned the Theſſalonians, as it did the Corinthians, that this gift of Languages ſhould be maintained among them, aſwell to evidence the preſence of the holy Ghoſt, as becauſe the things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired in ſtrange languages, being expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſerved for the uneſtimable edification of the people. If then theſe that ſtand upon this prohibition of the Apoſtle, will come into our Aſſemblies, and ſpeak the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Gods kingdome in Languages un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to them afore, if they will take upon them to reveal the ſecrets of mens hearts, to deſigne Miniſters of the Church, to decide matters in debate through the Church, by immediate inſpiration of the holy Ghoſt, and to make proof of theſe Graces, as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are to do, we will acknowledge, that the Offices of compoſing the prayſes of God, and conceiving Prayers in behalf of the Church, is to be referred to them upon the ſame terms, as it was to thoſe of whom we reade in the Apoſtle: nothing compoſed by humane reaſon ſhall be thought ſo accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, ſo much for the edification of his people, as that which his own Spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diteth. But if they dare not pretend to any
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:169390:113"/> ſuch Grace, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conſider upon what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences they pretend to the Priviledges of it. For they that pretend that the Church is bound to uſe their conceptions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, for the direction of the people, in publick prayers, upon this ground, becauſe they are the inſpirations of the holy Ghoſt, may by as good right pretend to decide all matters controverted in point of Faith, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all matters of diſpute in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, to root out and plant both Kingdomes and Churches. For that which the holy Ghoſt inſpireth for ordering of Church or Common-wealth, is as much to be executed, as that which it inſpireth for directing the prayers of Congregations. But if they diſclaim all pretence of immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate inſpiration, as there is no doubt but they do, and profeſſe no confidence, but of the bleſſing of Gods Spirit upon humane indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, perhaps complaining, that theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences are drawn upon them, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to thoſe opinions which they renounce; Firſt, it will be reaſon, that they be free in acknowledging and profeſſing their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in a matter of this conſequence. Becauſe it is certain, that the ſound of GODS SPIRIT, and the faſhion of Extemporary concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in Praying and Preaching, inſinuateth, and needs muſt inſinuate to the people, the pretenſe of immediate inſpirations, which to
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:169390:113"/> men of judgement they are conſtrained to diſavow. Then, this being done, our queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will be upon the right hinges, and the point to be decided will be this, Whether it be more for the edification of the people, in the direction of their publick Prayers, to uſe thoſe forms, which upon mature adviſe have been framed by the ableſt of thoſe, the Church had to intruſt with that buſineſſe, or theſe, which particular perſons, out of their readineſſe in conceiving and expreſſing thoſe things which they think fit to be ſaid, ſhall uſe in their Congregations. It hath been well obſerved already in this point, that the ſpirits of the people are ſtinted as much to the Form which the Miniſter conceiveth, as his ſpirit, to the form which the Church hath preſcribed. So that if the Church quench the Spirit in them, when it confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them to the forms which it hath advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they do no leſſe to the people, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining them to the form which they from time to time conceive. The precept of the Apoſtle cometh to one effect in both cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the queſtion that remaineth is, Which is more for the Edification of the people. Which, becauſe the Apoſtle in matters of this nature hath referred us to the common reaſon of men not poſſeſſed with prejudice, my deſire is, that the common ſenſe of Chriſtians may ſentence; diſpairing to cary
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:169390:114"/> any thing by diſpute of reaſon, at the hands of ſuch men as can make any queſtion in a matter ſo clear. But becauſe with reaſon it may be alledged, that mens particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions are more apt to addreſſe themſelves to the particular occaſions of Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, fit to be repreſented to God in their Prayers then a generall form is able to do, it will be requiſite further to repreſent, what advantages this convenience is out-wayed with on the other ſide. Firſt, in regard of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities of perſons, by whom it muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, let me congratulate with thoſe, that are ſo ſenſible of their own, that they would have other men, for a puniſhment of their negligence, to ſhame themſelves afore the people, in doing it as it ſhould not be done: But let me wiſh them more love to our common profeſſion, then to deſire to draw ſo juſt a ſcandall upon it. Is it like to grow commendable with the enemies of it, in this reſpect, becauſe the Miniſtery of publick Prayers, is ridiculous to our own people? Or what is the way to make Religion, and the Sacrifice of God ſtink in mens noſtrils, if this do not? Thoſe of the ableſt of this opinion think themſelves ill dealt with, when the ſtops and hummes of their Extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Prayers, are drawn in conſequence, to the prejudice of that way which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire to render commendable: but when we
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:169390:114"/> heare theſe flying pretenſes paſſe up and down, by which thoſe demurres of humane imperfection are intitled to thoſe unuttera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble groans which the Spirit of God inditeth, according to the Apoſtle, we have reaſon not to admire the occaſion of ſuch unſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able profaneneſſe. What ſhall we ſay then of the meaneſt rank of perſons, by whom Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary conceptions and expreſſions in ſuch high Offices muſt be miniſtred, but this, that the ill order by which they are vented to the world, muſt needs bring Religion to be contemptible? Again, in regard of mens opinions and inclinations, in regard of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall diſcretions and judgements, in point of what is fit to be recommended to God in publick Prayers, which way ſhall we attain that Order, that Reverence, which this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice requireth according to the Apoſtle? If men be left to themſelves, whatſoever opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in Religion, whatſoever debate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween neighbours, whatſoever publick mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Church or Common-wealth, a man ſhall pleaſe to make his intereſſe, upon like reaſon he may make the ſubject of his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and of the Congregation, which if it be not well directed (as what man is free from miſtake, where men may be and alwayes are of divers opinions) muſt either purſue his intereſſe, for the will of God in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, or as they are bound to be, muſt be
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:169390:115"/> ſcandalized at that which is done. I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther belie mine own ſenſes, then charge any man with that which appeareth not; but if experience tell us not, that ſuch things have been done, that mens prayers in the Church have ſmoked with their choler in private and publick matters, yet reaſon will tell us, how eaſily it may be done, and ſuch Ordinance pointed in time againſt them, that leaſt deſerve it in Church or Common-wealth. As the matter is among us, we ſee how farre mens minds are from being agreed, when we are to pray for fair weather, and when for rain: make particular perſons infallible Judges, not of a thing of that conſequence, but of whatſoever may be the ſubject of our prayers, and we make them all Popes in their Congregations: make them not infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and we multiply ſcandalls in the Service of God to the worlds end, to which no man ſhould come till all were ended. Laſt of all, it is not the ingenious conceptions of mens minds, it is not the eloquent expreſſions of their tongues, that God is affected with: the Miniſters devotion will prove more free to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, when his mind is leſſe at work in framing terms to expreſſe what he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to be for the purpoſe. But if we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard unto the meaneſt rank in knowledge, as well as in eſtate, which are alwayes the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part, and therefore in whom Charity hath
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:169390:115"/> the moſt ſhare, it will appear a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to their devotions, to run ſmooth upon the Forms to which they are practiſed, which muſt needs be intercepted with ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the meaning of new ones, which they are directed with. This is that which my reaſon is able to inform in this point, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a preſcript form of prayers be for the edification of the Church, in maintaining Order, and Reverence in the Publick Service of God, or not. Let us ſee which way the practice of the Church inclineth, or hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined: though the matter be great, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the meaning of the Apoſtles charge, and the form of ſerving God, a man ſhall have no cauſe to ſuſpect his own reaſon, when the reaſon of the Church, and the guides of it go before. But I muſt begin with the Publick Service of God in the Temple, ſo farre as it was morall, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted not in offering Sacrifices: That carrieth more prejudice with it then mans reaſon can inforce; That which was done there, is Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident enough to preſume, that the like is not againſt the Law of God and the Scripture. Of this we reade thus, 1. Chron. xxiii. 30. <hi>And to ſtand every morning to thank and praiſe the Lord, and likewiſe at evening: and at all offering burnt-offerings to the Lord, on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, the New Moons, and the Solemn Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.</hi> For without doubt, the purpoſe is here
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:169390:116"/> to ſpecifie at what times the Levites ſung the Pſalmes of Gods praiſes, to the Sacrifices that were offering in the Court of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whereof we reade afore, 1. Chron. xvi. 4. <hi>And he appointed of the Levites to Miniſter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Ark of the Lord: and to record, and thank, and praiſe the Lord God of Iſrael.</hi> And again, <hi>verſ.</hi> 37. the ſame is repeated. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, having ſpoken of the Prieſts, whom David left to ſacrifice upon the Altar at Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beon, it followeth, verſ. 41. <hi>And with them Heman, and Jeduthun, and the reſt that were choſen, that were expreſſed by name to give thanks to the Lord, becauſe his mercy indureth for ever.</hi> Here you ſhall perceive the time and the place of this Service expreſſed in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. Part of them with Aſaph, were to Miniſter before the Ark, part with Heman and Jeduthun to give thanks unto the Lord, where the Prieſts offered the burnt-offering morning and evening, <hi>verſ.</hi> 40. for the time that the Altar was at Gibeon, the Ark in the city of David. But for a perpetuall courſe, as you have it, xxiii. 30. <hi>To ſtand every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thank and praiſe the Lord, and likewiſe at evening: and at all offering of burnt-offerings to the Lord, in the Sabbaths, in the New Moons, and on the Aſſemblies.</hi> For thus it muſt here be tranſlated, as R. David Kimchi hath gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, That they ſhould alſo be ready to praiſe, when the burnt-ſacrifice is offered on
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:169390:116"/> the Sabbaths, and New Moons, and dayes of Aſſemblies; and alſo to help the Prieſts on theſe dayes, when there are many offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. For by this expoſition is ſignified both the help which the Prieſts had from the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites in ſacrificing, and alſo the kinds of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, at which the Levites ſung Pſalmes of Praiſe and Thankſgiving.

                  </gap>, <hi>And when do they ſing? Over all the burnt-offerings of the Congregation which were due, and over the peace offerings of an Aſſembly, at the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the wine: But the voluntary burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Congregation, over theſe they ſung not the Song.</hi> A Rule without doubt raiſed from the Scripture alledged; and the place here ſignified, where they ſtood to ſing, that is before the Ark, is the ſame that is ſignified at Solomons Sacrifice, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> v. 12. where they ſtood <hi>Eaſt from the Altar,</hi> as it muſt be tranſlated, that is, at the Eaſt Gate of the Temple, either before the mens Court, or before the womens Court. For at both theſe Gates there was a Pulpit for the Levites, where, at all theſe times, ſtood twelve at the leaſt, for this purpoſe, <hi>Maimoni</hi> (as before.) And before the latter were thoſe fifteen ſteps, from which the fifteen Pſalmes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees are named, becauſe they were ſung there, as the Talmudiſts will have it, <hi>Maſſ.

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:169390:117"/> upon it. To this muſt be added that memorable paſſage of the Samaritane Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle, publiſhed not long ſince, the tenour whereof is this, <hi>The High-Prieſt living at that time</hi> (that is the yeare of the world 4713. by their account) <hi>took away that moſt excellent book that was in their hands ever ſince the calme and peaceable time of the Iſraelites, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained thoſe Songs and Prayers which were ever uſed before their Sacrifices. For before every of their ſeverall Sacrifices they had their ſeverall Songs, ſtill uſed in thoſe times of peace, all which, accurately written, were tranſmitted to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent generations, from the time of the Legate</hi> (Moſes) <hi>unto this day, by the Miniſtery of the Holy Prieſt.</hi> For this whole paſſage ſpeaketh clearly of the Service of God in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſhewing us, that beſides the book of Pſalmes there were other Songs uſed at the Sacrifices of their ſeverall Solemnities, which were, according to the courſe of their Service, put together in one book for the purpoſe. There was beſides, another part of the Service done in the Temple, which men of learning have hit upon by conjecture, out of Apoc. viii. 3. <hi>And another Angel came and ſtood at the Altar, having a golden Cenſer, and there was given unto him much incenſe, that he ſhould offer it with the prayers of all Saints, upon the golden Altar which was before the Throne;</hi> joyned with Luk. i. 10. <hi>And the</hi>

                  <hi>whole multitude of the people were praying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out at the time of incenſe.</hi> From which Text Lud. Capellus collected, That while the Prieſt offered his incenſe in the Tabernacle, the people were at their prayers abroad, and that S. Johns Viſion alludeth to nothing elſe. Whereupon our Mead of Chriſts Colledge very ingeniouſly conceived, that where it is ſaid there, verſ. i. <hi>When he had opened the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Seal, there was ſilence in heaven about the ſpace of half an houre,</hi> all this was repreſented in reſemblance of the Service of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, where firſt the Praiſes of God are ſung, as it is before, vi. 9. then there is ſilence for half an houre, while the Prieſt within offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the incenſe, and the people without pray for remiſſion of ſinnes every one by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. For ſo I find this conjecture verified in <hi>Prike Aboth.</hi> v. 5. where one of the ten miracles, which the Jews relate fell out con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in the Service of God in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is this, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>the miracle happened to them, that they worſhipped at large, every man foure cubits from the next, that he might not heare him when he confeſſed and remembred his ſinnes.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſtood while the Levites ſung, at pouring the wine upon the burnt-offering, but when the Prieſt went to offer the incenſe, then fell every man down to make confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his ſinnes in private. Which being done, the Holy Prieſt, coming out into the Court, pronounced the Benediction, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in the Law, over the people, which was the end of Service. Of this Maimoni, of Prayer, and the Prieſts bleſſing, xiiii. 9. <hi>In the Temple, after the morning Service was done, the Prieſts went up into the Pulpit to bleſſe:</hi> which maketh me preſume, that the Order of Service in the Temple was no otherwiſe then hath been declared. Which Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus ſeemeth punctually to deſcribe in Onias, cap. l. 15, 16, 17. <hi>He ſtretched out his hand to the cup, and poured of the bloud of the grape, he poured out at the foot of the Altar a ſweet ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſavour unto the moſt high King of all. Then ſhouted the ſonnes of Aaron, and ſounded the ſilver trumpets, and made a great noiſe to be heard for a remembrance before the moſt High. Then all the people together haſted, and fell down to the earth upon their faces, to worſhip their Lord God Almighty, the moſt High.</hi> When the wine was poured forth, and the Prieſts blew
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:169390:118"/> the trumpets within, at Feſtivals, it is to be underſtood, that the Levites ſung the praiſes of God without at the ſame time, as we ſaw afore: and ſo it followeth in the next words, wherein this deſcription is repeated, verſ. 18, 19. <hi>The ſingers alſo ſang praiſes with their voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with great variety of ſounds was there made ſweet melody. And the people beſought the Lord the moſt High, by prayer before him that is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, till the ſolemnity of the Lord was ended, and they had finiſhed his Service.</hi> After all fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the Prieſts bleſſing, as Maimoni ſaid, verſ. 20, 21. <hi>Then he went down, and lifted up his hands over the whole Congregation of the children of Iſrael, to give the bleſsing of the Lord with his lips, and to rejoyce in his Name. And they bowed themſelves down to worſhip the ſecond time, that they might receive a bleſsing from the moſt High.</hi> I make no doubt but there was time for reading and expounding the Law in the Temple, as it hath been touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but becauſe I find no remembrance of it in this Service, and becauſe it concerneth not the point in hand, I let it alone. In this courſe of Service then, the prayer where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with each of them confeſſed their ſinnes was private and at pleaſure, the reſt was all by preſcript form. The Prieſts bleſſing expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Scripture: the praiſes of God, out of the book of Pſalmes, and others for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And this is the ſtrength of that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:169390:119"/> that is drawn from the Titles of the Pſalmes, ſhewing that they were indited for the purpoſe of praiſing God, and praying to him, as the tenour of them is. Two or three of theſe Titles it ſhall not be amiſſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce here. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> iiii. and all the reſt where the title is <hi>To the chief Muſician,</hi> the Chaldee tranſlateth <gap reason="foreign">

Laſt, the Title of thoſe fifteen Pſalmes after the cxx. called <hi>Pſalmes of Degrees,</hi> expounded as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, from the fifteen ſteps between the mens Court, and that of the Prieſts, is aſſurance enough that they were made to ſerve God with there. By which it appeareth, that the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:169390:119"/> Prophets of God, and their Diſciples, that the great Wiſemen of the Jews, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles of our Lord, when they frequented this Service, as ſhall be ſaid, thought not their ſpirits ſtinted by the preſcipt form of it. The Service of God in the Synagogues depended much upon this in the Temple; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it in me to imagine what reaſon can be alledged, why a preſcript form uſed in the Temple ſhould not fit the Synagogue. The way to put this paſt peradventure, had been to deſcribe the particulars of that Service, and to trace the Antiquity of them, from their beſt writings; but a diſcourſe too long and obſcure for this place. I ſhall be content to produce two or three paſſages, of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or circumſtance of it, by which ſhall appear whatſoever alterations it hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, (As at the preſent, in the ſubſtance of their Service all agree, though for the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars there is not more difference among Jews of ſeverall Countreys in any thing then in this, ſaith Leo Modena, in the piece na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med afore, <hi>P.</hi> 1. <hi>C.</hi> xi. 6.) that a preſcript form was uſed among them, under the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Temple, while they continued the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God. The Order whereof, for my part, I muſt needs referre to the Ancient Scribes that ſucceeded the Prophets; as mine Authour R. Moſes Maimoni hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the firſt particular which I intend
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:169390:120"/> to alledge, that is the xviii. Benedictions, wherein, praiſing God, they beg at his hands the ſupply of his daily bleſſings. Theſe, in his Treatiſe of Prayer and Benediction of the Prieſts, i. 2. he referreth to Ezra, as the Authour of them, when being returned from the Captivity, it was found that the people was not able to praiſe and ſerve God in a continued ſpeech, their language being mixed with that of ſtrangers. I confeſſe I ſhould have thought it a more probable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to have ſaid, that they were compoſed as a direction for the Service of God, both in publick and private, as ſtill their uſe is: But for this Authours credit, it is very well known, that all his ſtuff cometh from the beſt writings which that people have. And the agreement of the Jews of all Countreys, in theſe and the other Benedictions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are bound to ſay every day an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and that of old, ſufficiently ſheweth how ancient they are, when other ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents of their Service are ſubject to change with times and places: as their Hymnes for example, whereof is to be ſeen at large, in Abenezra upon Eccleſiaſtes, v. 1. where he diſputeth againſt thoſe of R. Eliezer hak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalir, preferring before them thoſe which R. Saadiah Haggaon had made. The ſecond particular, that I will produce, is the Service of the ſeven dayes Faſt, deſcribed in the

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:169390:121"/> of it, the peoples anſwer was, as afore, <hi>Bleſſed be the Name of his glorious Kingdome to all generations and evermore.</hi> And the caſe is related in the Miſna Taanioth ii. 5. that whereas once this anſwer was uſed in the Synagogue, the matter came before the WISE, (and, as I remember, it was before the great Sanedrin at Sippore, during the time that it ſate there, being removed from Jeruſalem, whereof afore) and their reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was, that it was not ſo practiſed, but onely at the Eaſt Gate, and in the Mountain of the Temple; that is, as Maimoni and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenora both expound it, at the Eaſt Gate of the Temple, and at the Eaſtern Gate of the Mountain of the Temple. To make the meaning of their reſolution to be this, that the anſwer of the people aforeſaid, in ſtead of Amen, which they uſed to anſwer in the Synagogue, was onely practiſed after the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction of the Prieſts which they gave at the Eaſt Gate of the Temple, as was ſaid, and at this Service of the Faſt of ſeven dayes in Jeruſalem, where it was done at the Eaſt Gate of the Mountain of the Temple, the outmoſt cloſe of it. But ſeeing the ſame Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was done throughout their Synagogues, as the cauſe required, of neceſſity the ſame form was uſed upon thoſe occaſions, and the like upon others. The laſt particular I ſhall produce, is a Circumſtance obſervable at all
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:169390:121"/> their Services, That whereas the reading of the Law and other Scriptures, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of it was done by principall perſons, the chief of the Synagogue, with their faces turned to the people as they ſate, as our Lord in the Synagogue of Nazareth, <hi>Luk.</hi> iv. 16. on the other ſide, the Prayers were read by him whom they call Apparitour of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, correſpondent to the Deacon in the Chriſtian Church, with his back to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and his face to the Ark and to the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. This Office, though of good account in the Synagogue, as we ſee in Maimoni of Prayer, <hi>C.</hi> viii. <hi>n.</hi> 11. being yet inferiour to the Scribes and WISE, it is plain to my common ſenſe, that it was not intruſted to direct the Prayers of their betters, in quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties proper to that work, upon other ground then this, becauſe the Prayers had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by thoſe wiſe and learned afore, and were therefore miniſtred by their inferiours, the Deacons of Synagogues. Such is he of whom Luke iv. 20. <hi>And he cloſed the book and gave it again to the Miniſter, and ſate down:</hi> Such is he that is called <hi>Apoſtle of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> in Maimoni, the place aforeſaid, that pronounceth the Service preſcribed there, and to ſhew that it was no late practice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them which he preſcribeth, is called in the Miſna, Beracoth v. 3. Taanith. ii. 2. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>the Ark:</hi> The reaſon, if my conjecture miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not, being this, Becauſe the place where he ſate among the Elders was higher then that of the people, by ſome ſteps, ſo that he muſt come down thoſe ſteps to ſtand before them, with his back to the people, in doing Service: As R. Benjamin in his Itinerary, <hi>p.</hi> 75. deſcribeth the chief Synagogue at Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat, that before the Ark there were ten ſtairs of marble, in the top whereof ſate the head of the Captains, of the linage of David. Now it is to be known, that things related in the Miſna, written in the dayes of Antoninus Pius, are not to be underſtood as if they were of no greater ſtanding then that time, but are the moſt Ancient Orders of that people, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed and delivered long afore from hand to hand, as things not lawfull to be committed to writing, and then firſt written, for fear that their manifold diſperſions might bring their Rules and Orders into oblivion, as themſelves profeſſe. As for the practice of the Church next to the Apoſtles, let me uſe the advantage which is due to the truth, and preſcribe one thing, in their way, that intend to prove it to be againſt the Scripture, and the Apoſtle, forbidding to ſtint the Spirit to uſe preſcript forms in praying, which is this; That it is not enough for their purpoſe, to ſhew out of ſome Church-writers, that ſome Churches might referre themſelves, in the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:169390:122"/> direction of their devotions, to their Biſhops or to their Presbyters; but it behoveth them to ſhew that they did it, as acknowledging that ſenſe of the Apoſtle, alledging their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and forbearing it as againſt Scripture. For there is a great deal of reaſon why that courſe might be tolerable and ſufficient in the beginning, while the Church was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the ſecular Powers of the Empire, and the fear of perſecution contained the people in reſpect to the Orders of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours, and them in reſpect to their Office, which afterwards, when the world was come into the Church, and the Empire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Chriſtian, would not ſerve the turn. Then as it was requiſite, that all Rules of the Church ſhould receive force from the ſecular Arm, ſo might it prove requiſite that the Order of Publick Service ſhould be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in a preſcript form, though it had been left to the diſcretion of particular perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; in regard of that good and bad fiſh that was come into the Net, and might take the occaſions pointed at to make rents in it. But I alledge this exception, to put them in mind, that no Eccleſiaſticall writer hath yet been alledged to uſe their reaſons, which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth juſt evidence of the Novelty of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion grounded on it: Not becauſe I do think the cauſe needeth it, or that any time of the Church can be ſhewed, after the Apoſtles,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:169390:123"/> and the time of extraordinary Graces, wherein a preſcript form of Publick Service hath not been uſed; much leſſe that any ſuch thing is proved by the words of Juſtine Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr and Tertullian, produced out of their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologies for the Chriſtians, wherein they inform the Powers of the Empire, what the Chriſtians did at their Aſſemblies. Which had they been but turned right into Engliſh, would have made it appear that they inforce either another ſenſe, or quite contrary to that which they are produced to prove.

Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, the ſubject of theſe Prayers, which he proſecuteth afterwards, is the ſame with the Prayers of their Aſſemblies, whereof he ſpeaketh, C. xxxix. and giveth juſt cauſe to think, that he ſpeaketh of private forms of devotion, borrowed from the publick. He ſaith there, that Chriſtians prayed with hands ſtretched out, to proteſt their innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; bare-headed, to profeſſe that they were not aſhamed, touching the Gentiles, that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered hands and faces in praying, which he interpreteth a confeſſion of guilt in the hands, an acknowledgement of ſhame in the face, which that habit ſignified, as hath been ſaid: And in the ſame ſtrain he goeth on, to tell them, that whereas they had their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancers to ſuggeſt the devotions they addreſſed to their ſeverall Deities, which he calleth Monitours, the Chriſtians prayed without Monitours, becauſe they prayed by heart.

The faireſt proof we can make, that the Church after the Apoſtles time, and the uſe of extraordinary Graces, betook the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to preſcript forms of Prayer, as well as other parts of Gods Service, will be from the parts of it. The Pſalmes of David, in the firſt place, do mix Prayers with the praiſes of God, and are no extemporary conceptions, yet were alwayes one of the firſt parts of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Service, as ſhall appear in due time. As for other Hymnes of private compoſure, Conc. Laod. Canon 15. <gap reason="foreign">

Theſe onely to be ſung out of thoſe books by Clergie Chanters, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:169390:125"/> in the liſt of the Church, that other perſons might take no occaſion to bring any into uſe, beſides thoſe that were preſcribed and received. I find that to meet with the poiſon of Arrius, <hi>ſicut in principio</hi> was added to <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> in the Church-Service. And I have heard, that to meet with the poiſon of Pelagius, they took up the cuſtome to put <hi>Dei Gratia</hi> in Titles and Inſcriptions of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. But that the cuſtome of uſing ſuch ſet forms was taken up firſt, becauſe the Arian and Pelagian hereſies conveyed and ſpread themſelves by that means, is ſtrange news to heare. It might have been ſaid with more reaſon of the hymns of Valentinus, ſo long afore, which Tertullian taxeth, <hi>De carne Christi,</hi> C. xvii. And let unpartiall reaſon anſwer the queſtion, Whether it be more like if any ſuch thing were, that they ſhould make that advantage, becauſe ſet forms were then in practice, or, Whether the Church ſhould fall to uſe that courſe, becauſe it was firſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up by theſe hereſies. In reading and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding the Scriptures, the queſtion is not made. But that is the particular, wherein I muſt yield ſomething of private conception to have been uſed in the Primitive Church-Service. It is believed, that in the flouriſhing times of the Church, Preachers were wont, in the beginning of their Sermons, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend themſelves and their labours to Gods
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:169390:125"/> bleſſing; the form is extant which S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe uſed, neither do we find that it was not at their own choice. But after the Sermon, the Catechumeni or Hearers, thoſe that were under Penance, thoſe that were vexed with unclean ſpirits, were diſmiſſed with the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Prayers of the Congregation &amp; Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Biſhop or Presbyter, on their ſeverall behalves. When that was done, the Prayers which were uſed at the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt by the Congregation that was admitted to it were of two ſorts, as ſhall be ſhewed afterwards, when I come to compare the Service which this Church uſeth, with that of the Primitive. The firſt was of thoſe which the Apoſtle calleth <hi>Supplications</hi> and <hi>Interceſsions,</hi> not onely for the generall and particular neceſſities both of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the members of it, but of all mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Church and Common-wealth, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or in particular, which are the ſame for ſubſtance which have ſince been called <hi>Lita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</hi> The ſecond was that <hi>Thankſgiving,</hi> from which that Sacrament is ſtill called the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, becauſe it was alwayes conſecrated with it; wherein remembrance was made of all the bleſſings of Gods Providence, in particular, that of our Lord Chriſt, which it pretendeth to commemorate with prayer that his Ordinance may be effectuall to the preſent. I know there followed Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:169390:126"/> after the Communion, beſides other pieces of that Service, as ſhall be ſaid: which I regard not ſo much now, becauſe they ſeem not to have been of ſuch conſideration, in the frame of their Service. My intent is to ſhow in due time, that theſe were the prayers practiſed upon the Apoſtles order, 1. Tim. ii. 1. <hi>I exhort therefore, before all, that Prayers, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, Interceſsions, and giving of Thanks be made for all men: For kings and all that are in Eminence:</hi> That they are the ſame which the Apoſtle intimateth, and ſpecifieth to have been practiſed, at that time, when he ſaith, 1. Cor. xiv. 15. <hi>I will pray with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but I will pray alſo with the underſtanding, I will ſing with the Spirit, but I will ſing alſo with the underſtanding: elſe when thou</hi> BLES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SEST <hi>with the Spirit, how ſhall he that filleth the place of the ignorant ſay Amen at thy</hi> GI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VING OF THANKS, <hi>ſeeing he knoweth not what thou ſayeſt?</hi> In fine, that theſe Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, Rom. viii. 26. when he ſaith, <hi>The Spirit it ſelf</hi> INTER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CEDETH <hi>for us with groans not to be uttered,</hi> are the ſame which in the Primitive Church were ſolemn &amp; perpetual before Celabrating the Euchariſt according to S. Chryſoſtomes Expoſition averred afore. This muſt be done after we have ſhowed, what reaſon there is to think, that the Euchariſt was celebrated at theſe Aſſemblies whereof the Apoſtle wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:169390:126"/> to the Corinthians, <hi>chap.</hi> xiv. In the mean time, as concerning the Prayers for Hearers, Penitents, and poſſeſſed Perſons, as well as the ſaid Supplications &amp; Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that they were all done by preſcript form, let me argue as I did afore, of the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Synagogue, becauſe they were miniſtred by the Deacon, as S. Chryſoſtome ſaid, and as it ſhall appear afterwards, by the remembrance we ſhall find of the Cuſtome of the Church. For I ſuppoſe no reaſon will yield, that the Church referred themſelves to be directed in their Publick Service by that rank of Miniſters. As for the THANKS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GIVING which the Sacrament was conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated with, I will here uſe no more then the words of S. Cyprian, de Lapſis, Serm. xiv. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi verò</hi> SOLENNIBUS <hi>adimpletis dare cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem Diaconus praeſentibus coepit,</hi> &amp;c. and in another place where he calleth it, <hi>Calicem</hi> SOLENNI <hi>benedictione ſacratum.</hi> And ask whether the Euchariſt were conſecrated with an Ex tempore Prayer, in Juſtine or Tertullians time, the form whereof by S. Cyprians time was become SOLEMN. Of the Preface <hi>Surſum Corda,</hi> remembred by the ſame S. Cyprian, <hi>de orat. Domini,</hi> and yet extant in all ancient Liturgies as well as ours, as well as of other particulars, there will be occaſion to ſpeak afterwards. From that which hath been ſaid of a preſcript form
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:169390:127"/> of Prayer at celebrating the Euchariſt, I will take upon me to preſume no leſſe of other Services at other Aſſemblies. <hi>Conc. Laod. Can.</hi> xviii. taketh Order, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>: <hi>That the ſame ſervice of Prayers ought to be performed both at ninth houres</hi> (at three after noon) <hi>and evenings.</hi> It hath been ſaid of late, that this Canon firſt confined the Prayers of the Church to a ſet Form, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding to uſe alwayes the ſame, but ſuch an one as every one compoſed for his own turn. This is argued from the iii. Councel of Carthage, after this of Laodicea, <hi>Can.</hi> xxiii. where it is ſaid, <hi>Et quicunque ſibi preces alicunde deſcribit, non eis utatur, niſi priùs eas cum inſtructioribus fratribus contulerit. And whoſoever copieth out Prayers for his uſe, from any where, let him not uſe them, till he have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated them with his more learned brethren.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, that the forms to be uſed be firſt allowed in the Synode, we are told was firſt ordered, in the ii. Councel of Milevis, ſome few years after this. The words are theſe, <hi>Placuit etiam illud, ut preces, vel orationes, ſeu miſſae, quae probatae fuerint in Concilio, ſive Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fationes, ſive Commendationes, ſeu mannum Impoſitiones ab omnibus celebrentur: nec alia omnino dicantur in Eccleſia, niſi quae à pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioribus tractatae, vel comprobatae in Synodo fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint, nè fortè aliquid contra fidem, vel per</hi>

It ſeemed good alſo that thoſe Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or Maſſes, which have been allowed in the Councel, whether Prefaces, or Commendations, or Impoſitions of Hands, be frequented of all; ſo that none at all be ſaid in the Church, but ſuch as have been treated by the more diſcreet, or allowed in the Synode, leſt perhaps ſomething againſt the Faith be compoſed, either through ignorance, or too little heed.</hi> With what judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment theſe bold conjectures are impoſed upon the world for truth, is now to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. Firſt, it is acknowledged on all ſides, among men of learning, that there is a great deal of confuſion in theſe Africane Canons, as they have been publiſhed in the Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Councels. In particular, by Juſtellus his preface and edition of thoſe Canons it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that the Councel which is there called the iii. of Carthage, <hi>Caeſario &amp; Attico Coſſ.

This alſo ſeemed good that theſe Prayers which have been allowed in the Councel, whether Prefaces, or Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or Impoſitions of hands, be frequented of all: ſo that by no means, others againſt the faith, be preferred</hi> (or <hi>ſaid) but theſe that have been compoſed by the more diſcreet, be ſaid.</hi> Balſamon upon this Canon, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>It ſeemeth ſome Biſhops took upon them to ſay Prayers not cuſtomed.</hi> It ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth indeed inconvenience was perceived, by the unconformitie of particular Epiſcopall Churches, upon alterations made by the Miniſters of them in their form of Service. Therefore it is provided, That the Service to be uſed be firſt approved in the uſuall Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:169390:128"/> of the Africane Churches, that all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopall Churches of thoſe Provinces might be conformable. But this ſuppoſeth a Form w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> thoſe Churches had, how ſhould elſe proviſion be made againſt alteration in it? And this being without doubt the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Canon, from which both thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited have been jumbled into the Councels ſpecified: neither can we allow them more credit, then can be thought due to him that pleaſed to make that jumble; nor can we admit any other ſenſe of the words of them, then the words of this Canon inforce. Which ſenſe, being of no more conſequence, will not be worth the while further to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute. And it is to be obſerved, that ſome Weſtern Canons have provided to the ſame purpoſe, that all the Churches of the ſame Province, be conformable in point of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Conc. Venet. C. xv. <hi>Rectum quoque duximus ut vel intra Provinciam noſtram Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crorum ordo, &amp; pſallendi una ſit conſuetudo. We have alſo thought it right, that in ſacred offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the order of ſinging, the ſame cuſtome hold through our Province.</hi> Conc. Epaon. C. xxvii. <hi>Ad celebrandum divina Officia, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, quem Metropolitani tenent, Provincia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les obſervare debebunt. For celebrating divine Offices, thoſe of Provinces ſhall be bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Order which the Metropolitanes hold.</hi> By which appeareth the point aimed at in all
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:169390:129"/> theſe Canons, to make the whole Province conformable in Divine Service. Which was without doubt the intent of that of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odicea, expounded by Zonaras, by that ciii. of the Africane Canons, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>The ſame thing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>doth this preſent Canon alſo ordain.</hi> Thus it is eaſy to perceive, that this Canon of Laodicea, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding that the order of Prayer be alwayes the SAME, intended not to appoint the SAME Miniſter alwayes to uſe the ſame order of Prayers, as is imagined, but that there ſhould be one Form unalterable, with reſpect to the Dioceſe of Aſia, for which it was Originally made: As that of Carthage, for the Dioceſe of Africk, and others for their ſeverall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces. And becauſe they allow by this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non every man to compoſe his own ſervice, ſo it be alwayes the ſame, let them take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice how this agreeth with Zonaras, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>Therefore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>this Canon ſeemeth to order the ſame, that whoſoever would ſhall not compoſe Prayers and ſay them at Aſſemblies.</hi> And now judge whether he or theſe new Maſters is beſt at expounding the Canons. Onely obſerve, That this xviii. Canon of Laodicea concerneth not the Service of thoſe Aſſemblies at which the Euchariſt was celebrated, of which alone that ciii. Africane Canon proceedeth: the title whereof is, <hi>De precibus ad altare dicendis, of Prayers to be</hi>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:169390:129"/> 
                  <hi>ſaid at the Altar.</hi> Whereupon it might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be conceived, that the ſaid pretended Milevitane Canon, where it ordereth the Prayers of the Euchariſt, requireth them to be allowed by the Synode; where it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them either to be allowed by the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node, or elſe treated by the more diſcreet, ſpeaketh of other Services ſuch as that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of Laodicea concerneth: but being of no more credit, it deſerveth not to be ſifted ſo near. Adde to all this the Tradition in the lives of the Popes, what this or that Pope added to the Prayers that the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt was celebrated with, which there is no reaſon to diſcredit for the whole, and it will appear both that there was a ſet Form from the beginning, and that it was ſubject to continuall alterations, the true reaſon why the Primitive forms cannot now be exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I am not ſo credulous as to intitle the Liturgies fathered upon S. James, S. Mark, S. Peter, no nor S. Baſil, or S. Chryſoſtome, as now we have them, to the perſons whoſe names they wear. But I am confident they are the Services frequented in the Churches of Jeruſalem, Alexandria, Rome, Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, and the parts of the Eaſt that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed S. Baſil, in celebrating the Euchariſt, from the time that they were put in this frame, and that to this frame they are reduced, through thoſe changes which ſeverall ages
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:169390:130"/> have brought to paſſe, from a preſcript form at the beginning, though not this. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, That which is called S. Peters, is word for word the Canon of the Romane miſſall, with ſome parts of the Eaſtern Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies, which I find not yet to have been frequented in the Weſtern. From hence we have ground enough to imagine, why it hath been called S. Peters. That of S. James we may diſcern to be the ſervice of the Church of Jeruſalem, by the particulars of it related to in the Catechiſes attributed to Cyrill of Jeruſalem, <hi>Catech.</hi> v. That of S. Mark may be diſcerned for the Service of the Church of Alexandria, by the great agreement it carrieth with that of S. Cyrill ſometimes Patriarch, and with the Ethiopick received from thence, as from their Mother-Church, both in <hi>Biblioth. Patrum.</hi> But as for the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations to which it is to be believed theſe Liturgies have been ſubject from time to time, we have this confeſſion of Victorius Sciatach, the Maronite at Rome, in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to Velſeius of Ausburg, before the three Liturgies, which at the requeſt of his friends, he turned for him out of the Arabick Copy ſent him by Scaliger. <hi>Nam ut Latini ipſi &amp; Graeci Pontifices, multa deinceps in ſuis Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giis, quas jam indè ab Apoſtolis acceperant, pro re nata, vel immutarunt, vel addiderunt: ità etiam ab Alexandrinis &amp; Aegyptiis, par eſt</hi>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:169390:130"/> 
                  <hi>credere, pro temporum opportunitate factitatum. For as the Latine and Greek Prelates either ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or changed, upon occaſion, divers things af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, in the Liturgies which they received even from the Apoſtles: ſo is it meet to think was done according to the occaſion of times, by thoſe of Alexandria and Egypt.</hi> Of the Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations made in the Romane Service by the Popes Gelaſius and Gregory the Great, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide others, the remembrance is quick and freſh in divers Writers. The like it is reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to conceive of other active Prelates. This he very pertinently argueth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from the Copie which he trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, in which the Liturgie called S. Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils was couched at large. Of the two that remain, intitled to Gregory the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and S. Cyrill, nothing was ſet down but the paſſages of difference from that of S. Baſil. Though being ſubject to ſuch continuall alterations, we cannot be bound to believe them, as they are, to have been compoſed by thoſe perſons whoſe names they bear. And this truth we muſt take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to be of great advantage to the cauſe of that Reformation which we profeſſe. For preſuming, as we do, that an alteration in matter of Religion hath come to paſſe, what better account can we give how it ſhould be effected, what more reaſonable way can we aſſigne, of conveighing it into the minds of
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:169390:131"/> the people, then by unſenſible alterations in the form of publick ſervice? which ſo long as we know in generall to have been done, there is juſt cauſe otherwiſe to preſume, that it hath been to that purpoſe which we op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And if the traces hereof were well hunted in particular, perhaps it might be made to appear to common ſenſe, in the main particulars which we profeſſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. So when demand is made to exhibit the Copies of Primitive Liturgies, the caſe is much as it was of old at Athens, in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute about Theſeus his ſhip in Plutarch, Whether this which had been ſo changed, that no man could tell what part of it remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were the ſame or not. Suppoſe we leave the Probleme to thoſe keen wits of Greece, that ſtarted it, I ſuppoſe it could not be queſtioned on any ſide, that there had been once ſuch a ſhip of Theſeus. In our caſe I ſhall hope to produce ſome ribs or limbes of the ſervice practiſed and preſcribed by the Apoſtle for the ſubſtance of it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though I preſume not with that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronite, that the Apoſtles themſelves preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the form, and delivered to thoſe which ſucceeded them, having ſhowed afore, That for that time the parts of it were miniſtred by immediate inſpiration of Gods Spirit: yet this I will take upon me to conclude out of the premiſes, that as it had been in the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:169390:131"/> Synagogue afore, ſo in the Church after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when thoſe inſpirations were ceaſed, they betook themſelves on all hands to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript forms, which at the firſt derived from the Primitive practice, retained that agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſeverall places which in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of them ſtill appeareth. And being propagated from the greateſt Churches at the firſt, have at length all yielded in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the principall. By <hi>Balſamon in Can.</hi> xxxii. <hi>Sex. Syn.</hi> and his anſwer to Mark Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of Alexandria, it appeareth how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous the ſervice of S. Chryſtoſtome, that is, of Conſtantinople, was to put down theſe of Jeruſalem and Alexandria. And it is well enough known how the Romane Maſſe, which was once the Gregorian Service, hath aboliſhed the Spaniſh, Gauliſh, and Germane Orders, and confined that which is intitled to S. Ambroſe to his own Church of Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain. That this perpetuall practice of the Church, of preſcript forms of Service is not againſt the Principles of the Reformation, or the judgement of chief Reformers, a few words ſhall ſerve to conclude. In particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, in this of England, for which I plead, That the Principall of the Clergie ſhould be imployed to adviſe the whole kingdome aſſembled, to inact a Form of Service, to the purpoſe that thoſe which could make no Prayers of their own head, might uſe it as
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:169390:132"/> cork to help them to ſwim with, not for any of theſe conſiderations expreſſed afore, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the practice of it once inacted, having been without interruption ever ſince, is a thing ſo farre from common reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that it is hard to believe that thoſe which ſpeak it believe themſelves in it. In Luthers Reformation the queſtion is not made, though there is no reaſon to be ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, why their example ſhould not be drawn into conſequence here. As for the other according to Calvine, ſo farre as my lot hath been to know the preacher of it, I confeſſe it is a thing which hath made me much mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, to ſee them ſo punctuall in practiſing their form preſcribed, that ſcarce any thing came from the Miniſters themſelves, but that very ſhort prayer afore the Sermon, wherein they recommend themſelves and their performance to the bleſſing of God, as you ſaw the faſhion was in the Ancient Church. Becauſe it is found that the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which this Church hath been diſquieted with, were taken up upon unreaſonable affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation to be conformable with them, thoſe that pretend their example are bound to ſhow us among them the Principle where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon this point is condemned, that a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript Form is that which the Apoſtle for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth in <hi>Quenching the Spirit.</hi> Therefore it will not be enough to ſay, That divers
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:169390:132"/> Churches of that Reformation, uſe to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the Order appointed them, and uſe the voluntary conceptions of their Miniſters in publick Prayers. For that may be thought of all, and of us, for the reaſons premiſed muſt be thought an example of ill conſequence, &amp; not for this Church to imitate. But it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to alledge the ſame reaſon from their Doctours, and to ſhow that they diſallow ſet Prayers, as <hi>Quenching the Spirit.</hi> To which purpoſe I have not yet heard any thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced either from the Fathers of the Church or from the Reformed Doctours. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore till that be done, I am bold to ſend home that Principle to them that have moſt right to own in, that is, to thoſe of the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from this Church of England, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to thoſe Germane Sectaries, that dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Enthuſiaſmes, and immediate inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

               <p>THe next point concerning in generall the Order of Publick Service, is the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of times, and dayes, and houres, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of frequenting our Aſſemblies for the purpoſe of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And firſt, the Order of daily Morning and Evening Service, how much it concerneth the edification of the Church, that is, the training of it in the exerciſe of Godlineſſe. A point otherwiſe to be plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then the reſt. For in other matters we have reaſon, or at leaſt the ſhadow of reaſon, to deal with: In this, it is not for Chriſtians to alledge, That it is not for the honour and glory of God to be ſerved in publick, or that it is not for the benefit of his people to joyn together in addreſſing their petitions, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing their daily wants at his hands. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe, as if theſe conſiderations were to give way to the occaſions of the world, thoſe that deny them not to be valuable, are content to let them, and the Order of daily Service grounded upon them, be uneffectuall and to no purpoſe. This is not the place to diſpute how much the conſideration of
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:169390:133"/> Gods Service is to out-weigh the world and the occaſions of it. Onely, becauſe it may be ſaid, How many idle bellies are maintained in the Church of Rome, to Pater over their Mattens and Evenſongs, in a manner not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by themſelves, and a language not underſtood by the people: let it be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, what greater advantage the devil could wiſh to make of this abuſe among them, then upon occaſion of it to bring the Service of God into disuſe among us; or how he could have improved this ſcandall to more purpoſe, for the hindering of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, then rooting out the ſubſtance of Gods Service, rather then reforming the abuſes of the manner of it. In the next place, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Feſtivall and Faſting-dayes from the ordinary, in reſpect to the Service of God upon them, is an Order much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the edification of the Church, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Godlineſſe. Here indeed ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe of reaſon hath been made, to ſhew that it is not in the power of the Church to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point Feſtivall dayes, as a thing contrary to the tenour of the Law which ſaith, <hi>Six dayes thou ſhalt labour and do all that thou haſt to do.</hi> I know not whether men by this time be ware of the miſtakes which this reaſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volveth, becauſe it maketh not ſo much noiſe in theſe dayes: but without doubt it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a groſſe inconſequence, to imagine an
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:169390:134"/> office of the ſecond Table, of labouring in ordinary work, to be commanded by a law of the firſt Table: but without doubt it was alwayes a groſſe inconvenience, to imagine God to give a command here, which we muſt ſuppoſe him to croſſe afterwards in the law of Moſes, when he cometh to appoint New-moons and other Solemnities to be obſerved on theſe ſix dayes. Therefore when the Commandment ſaith, <hi>Six dayes thou</hi> SHALT <hi>labour,</hi> the meaning is, <hi>Six dayes thou</hi> MAYEST <hi>labour:</hi> thou art licenſed and not forbidden to do thy daily work on them, by this Commandment. So it is tranſlated in our laſt Engliſh, Exod. xxxi. 15. <hi>Six dayes may work be done:</hi> And in the Ebrew the ſame word ſtandeth for both ſenſes. Laſt of all, whereas it is known that there were in the Jews Calendar, at the time when our Lord Chriſt lived upon earth, divers Solemnities beſides thoſe that were appointed by the law of Moſes, of which ſomething muſt be ſaid afterwards; and we know by the Goſpel, that our Lord himſelf kept the Feaſt of the Dedication inſtituted by Judas Macchabeus, by that particular we are aſſured, both that he obſerved the reſt, and that by obſerving he allowed and commended the Inſtitution in generall, for the purpoſe whereof we ſpeak. For, the bleſſings of God, whereof theſe Solemnities renew the remembrance,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:169390:134"/> are of that eſteem to the Church, that we are not able to expreſſe too much thankfulneſſe in taking that occaſion of ſolemnizing his Service. And the greateſt part of Chriſtians are ſuch as will receive much improvement in the principall Myſteries of our Faith, by the ſenſible inſtruction which the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch Solemnities yieldeth. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the Birth, the Sufferings, the Reſurrection and Aſcenſion of Chriſt, the Coming of the Holy Ghoſt, the Converſion of the Gentiles by ſending the Apoſtles, the way made before his coming by the Annun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of the Angel, and the coming of the Baptiſt, as it is a powerfull mean to train the more ignorant ſort in the underſtanding of ſuch great Myſteries, ſo it is a juſt occaſion for all ſorts, to make that a particular time of ſerving God, upon which we ſolemnize thoſe great works of his. For the purpoſe is not to hinder the occaſions of the world, by ſetting aſide mens ordinary work, but to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the Service of God before it. If the Publick Service of God be of better eſteem then the buſineſſe of this world, well may the Church own all the means by which ſhe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth to procure the exerciſe of it: but if the buſineſſe of this world, ſo far as it hindereth not the Service of God, be good &amp; commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, ſhe ſhall not need to own the reſtraint of it further then it tendeth to that purpoſe.
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:169390:135"/> Therefore provided, as it is among us, that the wholeſome effect of this Ordinance va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh not in the exceſſive multitude of Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, ordinary occaſions crowding out the remembrance of thoſe that deſerve it; it will not ſerve the turn to ſay, That the Papiſts have made theſe Solemnities the occaſion of worſhipping the Saints that own the dayes: To that muſt the ſame be anſwered as afore, That it is the uſe and improvement that the devil would chuſe to make of ſuch ſcandals, to prevent the abuſe of Gods Service, by rooting out the exerciſe of it. As for parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Solemnities of Faſting, by the week, or by the yeare, we are to conſider that abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence is not onely the cure of that ſenſuality which ſurfet breedeth, but the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full means to repreſent unto a man the whole condition of his ſoul towards God. Would a man deſire to humble himſelf in the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of his offenſes? Let common ſenſe be judge, whether he ſhall do it full or faſting to better purpoſe. Wherefore, being ſubject to runne into offenſe from time to time, what more wholeſome Ordinance can the Church have, then to Aſſemble from week to week to humble our ſelves in the preſence of God, and to labour to divert his due wrath, that it light not upon us in generall or in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular? And being ſubject nevertheleſſe to heap wrath againſt our ſelves, by ſlighting
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:169390:135"/> our continuall humiliation and repentance, what more Solemn Ordinance could reaſon deviſe, then Faſting before Feſtivals; then before the moſt Solemn yearly Feſtivall, the moſt Solemn yearly Faſt; by humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on going before, to eſtate us in the right of thoſe bleſſings which then we celebrate? Our Lord in the Goſpel hath ſaid of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, <hi>When the Bridegroom ſhall be taken from among them, then ſhall they Faſt in thoſe dayes:</hi> Should Chriſtians never Faſt but when publick calamities, or extraordinary occaſions of the Common-wealth call for it, well may it be asked, Where is the effect of theſe words? I ſpeak not now of any difference of meats for conſcience ſake, in that abſtinence is not ſeen in the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on now in hand: But I ſpeak of the Service of God upon theſe occaſions, which being appointed for humbling of our ſouls in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of our offenſes, common ſenſe will not refuſe, that abſtinence is neceſſary for the purpoſe. If it be ſaid in this point as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, That the Papiſts have abuſed this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to a ſacrilegious opinion of Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Merit, and the worſhip of God: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving declared a juſt and true reaſon and ground of the Ordinance, according to which it is no worſhip of God, but the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and means of his due and requiſite Service, the anſwer muſt be as afore, That it
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:169390:136"/> is the advantage which the devil would wiſh to make of ſuch abuſes, to make them the pretenſe to root out the Service of God, and ſo to ſave the pains of reforming it. The laſt conſideration which I referre to this head, concerneth the frequent Celebration and Communion of the Euchariſt, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the crown of Publick Service, and the moſt ſolemne and chief work of Chriſtian Aſſemblies. And though for the particular time of Communicating, it is rather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended then injoyned, yet the remembrance it importeth is ſo proper, ſo particular to the Profeſſion we make, that our Aſſemblies are never ſo like the Aſſemblies of Chriſtians, as when it is celebrated. And though it is not in men ſo to command the occaſions of the world, as to be alwayes diſpoſed to communicate, yet, that in the generall of the Church there ſhould not alwayes be perſons diſpoſed to communicate, that it ſhould not be celebrated for thoſe which are diſpoſed to communicate, is an inconvenience, for which nothing but too much love of the world, too much backwardneſſe from ſpirituall duties, can be alledged. For if it be ſaid, That the Church of Rome, by retaining the Cuſtome of celebrating day by day, hath turned the Communion into a Sacrifice for the quick and dead; the anſwer muſt be as afore, That it is the uſe which the enemy of mankind
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:169390:136"/> would chuſe to make of their abuſes, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men, that ſo long as private Maſſes are aboliſhed, they are at freedome to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure of the frequent Celebration and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Euchariſt. If any man think that under this which hath been ſaid, there is an intent to ſhoulder out Preaching, by commending other cauſes of Religious Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, he ſhall both wrong my meaning, and miſtake the truth of the cauſe. He that will have men to Preach more then they learn, and to void thoſe crudities in the Church which were never digeſted in their ſtudies, perhaps may have reaſon to think, that where the ſtuff is ſlight, there the larger meaſure is due: but beſides the ſcandals ſuch raw doctrine muſt needs breed, he ſhall be ſure to bring a ſlight eſteem upon that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, wherein God is ſerved no otherwiſe. But he that will provide abilities of men for ſo great a work, ſhall find, that theſe Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies on Feſtivall and Faſting-dayes, the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions whereof are here commended, ſhall miniſter opportunities of continuall Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, even beyond thoſe of hearing, alwayes for the edification of the Church, where men are able to ſupport the reſpect and eſteem of ſo great a work. It is now time to put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Primitive practice of the Church, in the particulars here touched, deriving it as near as can be from the time of the Apoſtles.
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:169390:137"/> It is thus written of the firſt Diſciples, Acts ii. 42. <hi>And they continued ſtedfastly in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles Doctrine, and Communion, and in break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bread, and Prayers.</hi> And verſ. 46. <hi>And day by day continuing with one mind in the Temple, and breaking bread from houſe to houſe, did eat their meat with gladneſſe and ſingleneſſe of heart.</hi> Again, iii. 1. <hi>Now Peter and John went up together into the Temple, at the houre of prayer, being the ninth houre:</hi> that is, three after noon. The Synagogues were inſtituted for the morall and perpetuall Service of God, by prayer, and praiſing him, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding his word, leaving the figurative worſhip of Sacrifices to the Temple: upon which nevertheleſſe the circumſtances of that morall Service depended, as hath been obſerved out of R. Moſes Maimoni, Tephil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah Ubircath Cohenim, <hi>C.</hi> l. <hi>n.</hi> 7. and muſt be repeated here. Thus he delivereth; That correſpondent to the daily Sacrifice Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Evening, there was ordered among them, and practiſed, one Service for the Morning, another for the Evening: that therefore called <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And on Solemn dayes, when there was a Sacrifice more then ordinary offered by the Law, a third called <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:169390:137"/> ordered a prayer at night, which, though not obligatory, he ſaith was practiſed by all Iſrael. Of the Service appointed for Faſting-dayes, at cloſing in the Evening, called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by them <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, I need ſay nothing here. <hi>C.</hi> ii. <hi>n.</hi> 2. he declareth, that becauſe, when the Eve of the Paſſeover fell upon the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, the Evening Sacrifice was killed half an houre after noon; therefore the time from which the Evening Sacrifice became due was from thence to half an houre after three; which was called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the great Evening Service, the leſſe being from thence to Sunne-ſet. So that he who prayeth this Service from half an houre after twelve, is disobliged of the debt of it: And upon what terms it is ſaid, either at both theſe houres, or at the one, according to their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, it followeth there, <hi>n.</hi> 3. Of theſe three Services, the Ebrew Doctours, Maimoni as afore, Abenezra upon <hi>Pſal.</hi> iv. 6. R. Saadiah upon <hi>Dan.</hi> vi. 10. conſtantly expound the words of the Pſalmiſt there; <hi>Evening, and Morning, and at Noon will I pray, and cry aloud, and he ſhall heare my voice.</hi> And that of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel, <hi>He kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before God, as afore time.</hi> Whence it ſhould ſeem, that when S. Peter went up to pray upon the houſe top a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſixth houre, <hi>Acts</hi> x. 9. his meaning was to obſerve the lawfull houre of the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:169390:138"/> Evening Service half an houre after Noon: though, being at Jeruſalem, he went up into the Temple with John at the houre of Prayer, being the ninth houre, when this Service was performed there, in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the people. The ſame which Judith obſerved, as we reade, Judith ix. 1. <hi>About the time that the incenſe of that Evening was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in Jeruſalem, in the houſe of the Lord, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dith cried with a loud voice and ſaid.</hi> According to that of the Pſalme, <hi>Let my Prayer be ſet forth in thy ſight as the incenſe, and let the lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of my hands be an Evening Sacrifice,</hi> as you heard afore, that their prayers in the Temple were offered at the time of incenſe. Thus the order of the Synagogue aimed at the Sacrifices, which by the Law were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the Temple. In the Church, it was received of very ancient time, to pray at nine, at twelve, and at three afternoon, aiming, it ſhould ſeem, at the practice of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, and of the Apoſtles according to it, but with the difference you ſee, that they prayed thrice in the day time, whereas the Jews third Service was at going to bed, as you have it in Maimoni as afore. Tertullian, <hi>De Jejun. adv. Pſych. C.</hi> x. ſheweth, that the houres of nine, and twelve, and three were cuſtomed for Prayer by the Chriſtians of that time, by proving it from the example of the Diſciples aſſembled, as S. Peter ſaith,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:169390:138"/> 
                  <hi>Acts</hi> ii. 15. upon the third houre of the day; of S. Peter, that went up to pray at the ſixth houre; and of Peter and John, that went up to the Temple at the houre of prayer, being the ninth houre. And then it followeth, <hi>Quod etiam ſuadet Danielis quoque argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, ter die orantis, utique per aliquarum hora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum exceptionem, non aliarum autem quàm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigniorum exinde Apoſtolicarum, tertiae, ſextae, nonae. Hinc ita<expan>

Which alſo Daniel his praying thrice a day argueth, forſooth, excepting ſome houres, and thoſe no other then theſe of the Apoſtles, which thence were more notable, the third, ſixth, and ninth. Hereupon I would ſay, that Peter rather obſerved the ninth by ancient cuſtome, praying the third time, as the laſt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Here lieth the difference. It is the third prayer of the day, according to Tertullian, which Peter and John offered at the time of Evening Sacrifice, which theſe Ebrew Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours make but the ſecond. Whatſoever become of this difference, as concerning the houres of mens private prayers, the publick houres of the Temple, obſerved by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, became a Preſident to the Church for the Publick Service of God at their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies. In the Conſtitutions of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, they are exhorted to pray the Lords Prayer thrice a day, according to Tertullian,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:169390:139"/> vii. 24. They are again exhorted to pray at other houres beſides, viii. 36. But as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Aſſemblies, thus he inſtructeth the Biſhop to teach the people, juſt accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the practice of the Synagogue, alledged out of Maimoni ii. 58. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>But in teaching, O Biſhop, charge and inſtruct the people to be continually at Church, Morning and Evening every day, and not abſent at all.</hi> Whereas upon Lords dayes, in the ſame place he remembreth three Services, which ſeem to be thoſe whereof the Canon of Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea ſpeaketh, where it appointeth the ſame Service of Prayers to be uſed, both at three and at Evenings, meaning upon Lords dayes, according to theſe Conſtitutions. It is not then this Authours judgement, (upon which I ſtand not) but it is the Example of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and Primitive Diſciples, reſorting to the Temple to ſerve God with the Jews, in the Service there practiſed, and that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the cuſtome of the Synagogue; but it is the cuſtome of the Church by him remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, and derived from their Example, that muſt needs recommend with great weight unto us the order of this Church, as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing daily Morning and Evening Service. And to the ſame purpoſe, in the Reformation, Calvine upon Acts iii. 1. <hi>Inſtituerat Dominus</hi>

God hath appointed the Jews to offer Sacrifice morning and evening.

Ac hodie, niſi obſtaret nimius torpor, utile eſſet quotidie haberi tales conventus. Firſt, whereas God appointed his ancient people ſet houres, thence we gather, that the Church cannot be without a certain diſcipline. And at this day, if too much dulneſſe hindered not, it were uſefull every day to hold ſuch Aſſemblies.</hi> Of Feſtivals appointed by the Guides of the Synagogue, not by the Law of Moſes, we have foure, to my remembrance, expreſſed in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. The firſt is that of Purim, <hi>Eſther</hi> ix. 20. The ſecond, the Feſtivall of the Law, upon <hi>Tiſri</hi> xxiii. obſerved ſtill among the Jews for making an end of reading the Law, which they begin to reade over again the next Sabbath; pointed at <hi>Nehem.</hi> viii. 9. ix. 1. as Scaliger <hi>De Emend. Temp.</hi> vii. <hi>Not. in Comp. Jud.</hi> hath excellently obſerved. It is firſt to be known, that the Feſtivals of the Law were appointed to be ſolemnized with mirth and gladneſſe of heart: wherefore they are called, Num. x. 10. <hi>The dayes of your</hi>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:169390:140"/> 
                  <hi>gladneſſe.</hi> And in the Pſalme for the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, xcii. 4. the Pſalmiſt in this reſpect, <hi>For thou Lord haſt made me glad through thy works,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I will triumph in the works of thy hands:</hi> expreſſing the ſubject of that gladneſſe, the remembrance of the Creation, upon that day celebrated. Though the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of reſt upon the Sabbath was ſtrict, yet when our Saviour went into the houſe of one of the chief Phariſees to eat bread on the Sabbath, <hi>Luke</hi> xiv. 1. this invitation and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment is argument enough that it was Feſtivall, for the manner of obſervance. Hereupon it is, that the people falling to weep upon hearing the Law read, the firſt day of the Feaſt of Tabernacles, <hi>Nehem.</hi> viii. 9. are forbidden to violate the Law of the Feaſt, and commanded to obſerve the day in the right nature of it. Whereas the people then, being forbidden to mourn on the Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall, are ſaid, ix. 1. to have faſted on the xxiiii. of that moneth, we have cauſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume with him, that the Faſt, whereof they acknowledged the cauſe, upon the firſt day of that Feaſt, was deferred till the uſuall So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities of it were paſt; which by the Law ending upon the xxii. and the Faſt not kept till the xxiiii. it is plain that the reaſon was, the Feſtivall of the Law, falling then, and obſerved upon the xxiii. as now, not by the Law, but by the Conſtitution of their
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:169390:140"/> Elders. The third is the Feaſt of the wood-offering, of which Nehem. x. 34. <hi>And we caſt lots among the Priests, the Levites, and the People for the wood-offering, to bring it into the houſe of our God, after the houſes of our fathers, at times appointed yeare by yeare, to burn upon the Altar of the Lord our God, as it is written in the Law.</hi> And xiii. 31. <hi>And for the wood-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at times appointed.</hi> The ſame Scaliger con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth out of Joſephus, that this Feſtivall fell upon the xxii. of the moneth Ab, to which ſenſe he referreth the words of Orach Hajim, AB <hi>eſt rex, quòd in eo caederent ligna in Sacrificium:</hi> AB <hi>is a King</hi> (among Moneths) <hi>becauſe upon it they cut wood for the Sacrifice.</hi> But the truth is that which the Miſna rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, <hi>Maſſ.

For this is that which the Scripture ſaith, <hi>At times appointed yeare by yeare.</hi> The laſt is the Dedication of the Temple by Judas Macca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beus, which our Lord obſerved, <hi>John</hi> x. 22. neither is it within the compaſſe of common ſenſe, to imagine that he did otherwiſe in the reſt of the Solemnities, which were then for certain in the Jews Calendar. As for their times of Faſting, the day of Atonement ſtood by the Law of Moſes, and the reſt appointed for it, as ſtrict as that of the Sabbath; but the nature of the obſervance quite otherwiſe,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:169390:141"/> with humiliation and afflicting the Soul. There were divers other Faſts which that people took upon them to obſerve, not upon the Law, but upon publick Order and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, upon ſet dayes of ſeverall moneths, as in their Calender is yet to be ſeen; whereof ſome are remembred in the Scriptures. <hi>Zach.</hi> vii. 5. and viii. 19. we reade of the Faſts of the fourth, and fifth, and ſeventh, and tenth moneths, in remembrance of thoſe calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which God had puniſhed the ſinnes of that people with upon thoſe dayes, moſt of them ſtill remembred in their writings.

The words of the Phariſee bear further, that they were obſerved with faſting: and, beſides E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanius, their own writers have delivered no leſſe. But the obſervance, without doubt, was not ſo ſtrict upon them, elſe could not the Phariſee have alledged it for his own praiſe. And the Order of proclaimed Faſts, whereof I began to ſpeak, argueth no leſſe. It was at the leaſt for three dayes, beginning at the Munday, and ſo on the Thurſday, and Munday next, Maimoni <hi>Taanioth. C. i. n.</hi> 5.

If theſe dayes then had been faſted ordinarily with ſuch ſtrict obſervance, then could not the extraordinary Faſts, which were purpoſely caſt upon the ſame dayes, have been perceived. The inſtitution and obſervation of theſe Solemnities in the Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agogue, as it regarded no Ceremoniall Service, which figured things to come, but the Service of God by publick Prayers, and the Praiſes of God with hearing his Word upon the remembrance of his bleſſings, or of our miſdeeds, was a due Preſident for the Church to follow, according to the chief occaſions miniſtred by the Principles of our Faith. The Reſurrection of our Lord in the firſt place. Who can doubt that the proper day of it was ſolemnized from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, acknowledging, as we do, that it was the ground of determining the day which we celebrate through the yeare, in ſtead of the Jews Sabbaths: and ſeeing the Apoſtles aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled the next Pentecoſt after it, <hi>Acts</hi> ii. 1. we know there was from the beginning a great deal of difference and debate about the time, thoſe ancient Chriſtians of Aſia ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing

But in that which remaineth of I. reneus his words, there is, and ſeemeth to have been for divers hundred years, a ſlight difference of reading in the copies of Euſebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, which inferreth a main difference in the ſenſe: That reading which Chriſtoferſon tranſlated in Latine, acknowledged of late by Petitus, <hi>Var.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. That is, <hi>For ſome think they are to faſt one day, ſome two, ſome more, ſome fourty: and they meaſure their day by the houres of the day and night.</hi> Meaning that when they faſt, they faſt from evening to evening. Which is more, Ruffinus read it no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: for thus he tranſlateth thoſe laſt words, <hi>Nonnulli etiam quadraginta: Ità ut horas di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnas nocturnáſque computantes diem ſtatuant.</hi>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:169390:143"/> Meaning, that ſome faſted fourty dayes, but that thoſe which faſted fourty dayes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted every day foure and twenty houres of the day and night. By this reading, thoſe ſome of whom Ireneus ſpeaketh, kept Lent fourty dayes, even afore his time: though as Petitus fairly conjectureth, not upon all, but upon ſome dayes of each week, as it hath been ſhewed, that the Jews kept their long Faſts but on Mundayes and Thurſdayes; and as he duly proveth, that in S. Auguſtines and Leo the Greats time, they faſted the Lent at Rome but three dayes in a week.

This reading maketh the conjecture probable, that it was firſt called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>quadrageſima,</hi> for the number of fourty houres, which they faſted at the beginning for the time of our Lords being under the power of death, from twelve on Friday till the Sunday morning. For in the Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Apoſtles v. 14. the Faſt is not to be ended till then at Cocks crowing, which afterwards was inlarged to fourty dayes, as the Authour alledged by Rhenanus ſaith, <hi>That it was at the firſt of fourty houres, an houre for a day,</hi> to wit, of thoſe dayes that were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved afterwards. The iſſue of this diſpute, Whether fourty dayes were obſerved in the Church before Ireneus his time, or not, muſt reſt upon the true reading of his words in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius: For though there is mention of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>Quadrageſima</hi> in Ignatius, and perhaps elſewhere, yet it is not ſaid to be called ſo from fourty dayes, in the writings
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:169390:144"/> of thoſe times, to my knowledge. In the mean time it is manifeſt, that there is no time of the Church to be aſſigned, when the Feſtivall of the Reſurrection, and the Faſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, was not ſolemnized. The Faſt upon Wedneſdayes and Fridayes is referred to the like reaſon in the Conſtitutions of the Apoſtles, v. 14. vii. <hi>The Wedneſday is to be fasted,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>becauſe on it our Lord was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, and the bargain made between Judas and the Prieſts.

                  <hi>But the Aſſemblies we hold are appointed by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles upon the Wedneſday and Friday, and upon the Lords day; upon thoſe in Faſting untill the ninth houre.</hi> I marvell not to heare him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre thoſe Cuſtomes, whereof they knew no beginning, to the Order of the Apoſtles. But the terms on which the Catholick Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſtand againſt Montanus and his ſect, in Tertullian, <hi>de Jejun. c.</hi> ii. may help to lead us to the true ground of it: <hi>Itaque de caetero indifferenter jejunandum, ex arbitrio, non ex imperio novae diſciplinae, pro temporibus &amp; cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis uniuſcujuſque. Sic &amp; Apoſtolos obſervaſſe, nullum aliud imponentes jugum certorum &amp; ab omnibus obeundorum jejuniorum; proinde nec</hi>

                  <hi>ſtationum, quae &amp; ipſae ſuos dies habeant, quartae feriae &amp; ſextae, paſsivè tamen currant, neque ſub lege praecepti. Therefore otherwiſe</hi> (beſide the dayes on which the Bridegroom was taken away) <hi>they ſay we are to fast indifferently, arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, not upon command of the new diſcipline, according to each mans times and occaſions. And that ſo the Apoſtles obſerved, impoſing no other yoke, of certain Fasts to be performed of all; neither by the ſame reaſon, of Stations, which, they ſay, have alſo their dayes of Wedneſday and Friday, but of ordinary courſe, under the law of no precept.</hi> For which cauſe he calleth theſe Stations, <hi>ſemijejunia,</hi> or, <hi>half Faſts, c.</hi> 13. of that book. The Wedneſday and Friday Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of the Primitive Chriſtians, with Faſting, were not of ſuch ſtrict and ſolemn obſervance. No more were thoſe of Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes and Thurſdayes in the Synagogue, and therefore taken up, in imitation of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, and upon the like reaſons. The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall whereof is well laid down by S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome upon <hi>Gal.</hi> iiii. 10. His queſtion is, how the Church, appointing Feſtivals and ſet times of Faſtings, is clear of the Apoſtles charge upon the Galatians there, <hi>Ye obſerve dayes, and moneths, and years; I fear leſt I have laboured upon you in vain.</hi> His anſwer is, firſt, <hi>Et nè inordinata congregatio populi fidem im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minueret in Chriſtum, propterea dies aliqui ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuti ſunt, ut in unum omnes pariter veniremus;</hi>

                     </gap>ate faith in Chriſt, therefore certain dayes are appointed for all to aſſemble at once: not becauſe the day on which we aſſemble is more not able then others, but becauſe on what day ſoever we aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by ſeeing one another, more gladneſſe ariſeth.</hi> Meaning that gladneſſe wherewith they ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated their Feſtivals. So his mind is, that all difference of dayes among Chriſtians, is in reſpect to the Order of their Aſſemblies, and that in reſpect to the work of thoſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies. Again, <hi>Qui ſubtiliùs reſpondere co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur, dies omnes aequales eſſe ait, Jejunia autem &amp; Congregationes, inter dies, propter eos, à vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris prudentibus conſtitutos, qui magis ſaeculo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant quàm Deo, nec poſſunt, imò nolunt, toto in Eccleſia vitae ſuae tempore congregari, &amp; ante humanos actus, Deo orationum ſuarum offerre Sacrificium. One that indeavoureth to make a more ſubtle anſwer, ſaith, that all dayes are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, but that Faſts and Aſſemblies are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among other dayes by diſcreet men, for thoſe that ſpend more time in the world, then on God, and can not, nay will not aſſemble all dayes of their life, in the Church, to offer unto God the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of their Prayers before humane actions.</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that whereas the Jews Service was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to certain times, that of Chriſtians is
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:169390:146"/> alwayes ſeaſonable. The Primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were alwayes aſſembled, alwayes in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture for the Service of God, as we reade in the <hi>Acts:</hi> when the number increaſed, there was no expectation of humane reaſon, that they could continue ſo unanimous in fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting their Aſſemblies for that purpoſe. The neglect of them muſt needs prove an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement; the diſorder of them, a ſcandall to the Faith. Here the wiſdome and the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church-guides behoved to take place, by cuſtoming certain times, whereof the occaſion was juſteſt, to confine men from Secular imployments to better purpoſes. And how this courſe prevailed in matter of Feſtivals, I referre to thoſe well known words of S. Auguſtine, <hi>Ep.</hi> cxviii. where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to inſtance in ſome univerſall cuſtome of the whole Church, <hi>Sicuti,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>quòd Domini Paſsio, &amp; Reſurrectio, &amp; Aſſcenſio in Coelum, &amp; Adventus de Coelo Spiritûs ſancti, anniverſariâ ſolennitate celebrantur, &amp; ſiquid aliud tale occurrit, quod ſervatur ab univerſa, quacun<expan>

                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> ſe diffundit, Eccleſia. As, that the Paſsion, the Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion of our Lord into Heaven, and the Coming of the Holy Ghoſt from Heaven, is celebrated with yearly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, and if there be any thing elſe which all the Church, whereſoever diſperſed, obſerveth.</hi> As for times of Faſting, the anſwer of our Lord importeth two things: Firſt, that his
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:169390:146"/> purpoſe was, that the outward freedome, which he allowed his Diſciples for the time, ſhould ſymbolize with the inward comfort which the Goſpel profeſſeth, and conduct and train them (as trained they were by his Doctrine, in divers particulars, by corporall to ſpirituall things) to underſtand it. The ſecond, the reaſon of this purpoſe, becauſe they were old veſſels for the preſent, which a ſtrict diſcipline for the preſent might cauſe to flie in pieces: but when the new wine of the Holy Ghoſt ſhould make the veſſels new, into which it was put on the day of Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt, then ſhould they Faſt, then ſhould they be willing to undertake the diſcipline which their Profeſſion ſuited with. Accordingly we may find them ſerving God with Prayer and Faſting, <hi>Acts</hi> xiii. 3, 4. xiiii. 23. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe diſorder or coldneſſe in this voluntary performance might diſadvantage the Faith, it ſoon proved time to bring thoſe voluntary obſervances to ſet rules of practice. Theſe cauſes thus diſpoſing the Church, and the Preſident of the Synagogue directing not to do leſſe, what courſe ſhould it obſerve, but, in ſtead of Mundayes and Thurſdayes uſed in the Synagogue, to practice Wedneſdayes and Fridayes for this purpoſe? holding in them a convenient diſtance from the Lords day, as thoſe other did from the Sabbath. Their Writers tell us, beſides the reaſon ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:169390:147"/> out of Maimoni afore, that they might not reſt three dayes from hearing the Law, that they made choice of Mundayes and Thurſdayes in regard of ſome great calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that befell their nation upon thoſe dayes: What marvell is it if the Church had regard to thoſe which befell our Lord on the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday and Friday, the other Morall reaſon of aſſembling once in three dayes for Gods Service concurring? Thoſe ancient Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of Tertullians time, conceived that the Faſt afore Eaſter is appointed in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which ſaith, <hi>The dayes will come that the Bridegroom ſhall be taken from among you, and then ſhall ye Faſt in thoſe dayes,</hi> and Tertullian is content to have it believed, becauſe Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus required that and more. But S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine found that there is a command in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to Faſt, but no time commanded when it ſhall be done, <hi>Ep.</hi> lxxxvi. So he would have accepted their reaſon, as an alluſion handſomely ſymbolizing with the nature of Faſting, but the appointment he muſt needs referre to the Cuſtome of the Church, and the Ordinance of the Guides of it. It is not much otherwiſe with thoſe other dayes wherewith ſome inlarged the Faſt afore Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, even afore Ireneus his time: It is not much otherwiſe with the Wedneſday and Friday Aſſemblies, though Tertullian is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have them both counted innovations
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:169390:147"/> in the Church, on purpoſe to bring them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to rank with Montanus his diſcipline, for which he pleadeth, recharging the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Chriſtians, <hi>Et praeter Paſcha jejunantes, ultra illos dies quibus ablatus eſt ſponſus, &amp; Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionum ſemijejunia interponentes. Both as Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beſides the Paſſeover, over and above thoſe dayes on which the Bridegroom was taken away, and interpoſing the half Faſts of Stations,</hi> De Jejun. c. 13. But the betraying of Chriſt and his death, is a reaſon that may take place to move them that have reſolved to appoint ſet dayes of Faſting every week, to chuſe the dayes on which thoſe things fell out afore o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, eſpecially being in a convenient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Lords day, the Aſſemblies whereof were moſt ſolemn; otherwiſe, to think that there was no more reaſon then that for an appointment of ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, is to make them as childiſh as they would have them, that had rather deſpiſe then either obſerve or underſtand their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, though the purpoſe be no more then to bring the precepts of Faſting and of the Publick Service of God, into the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and uniform practice of his Church, which being commanded but in generall, without ſuch particular appointment are not like to be exerciſed to great purpoſe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the diſcipline of Montanus, ſet up in downright terms as ſchiſme in the Church
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:169390:148"/> by aſſembling apart for the exerciſe of their own particular and voluntary obſervations, whatſoever hereſies beſides it may have been imbarked with. How ancient the obſervation of Wedneſday and Friday Aſſemblies was in the Church, is to be valued by the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of them in Ignatius, <hi>Ep. ad Philip.</hi> and Clemens Alexandrinus, <hi>Strom.</hi> v. How uniform the obſervation of them was in the Ancient Church, is to be known from Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius his words, <hi>Haer.</hi> lvi. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>; <hi>Who agreeth not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in all climates of the world, that the Wedneſday and the Friday are Faſts appointed in the Church?</hi> And when Tertullian ſaith in the ſame <hi>C.</hi> 13. afterwards, that the Biſhops were wont to appoint extraordinary Faſts upon occaſions which made the Church ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous; there can no queſtion be made, but they were wont to chuſe the Wedneſdayes and Fridayes to be obſerved with more ſtrictneſſe upon theſe occaſions: becauſe we ſaw afore that all Faſts that were indicted in the Synagogue, were by Order to fall upon the Mundayes and Thurſdayes, which in a lower degree they obſerved otherwiſe. And therefore the Orders of this Church of England, inſtituting Feſtivals for the Publick Service of God, in remembrance of his moſt remarkable bleſſings, inſtituting times of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:169390:148"/> and Faſting, for diverting his wrath, which our ſinnes contract from time to time, ſtandeth recommended to us by the practice of the moſt ancient times of the Church. Setting aſide difference of meats for conſcience ſake, whereof we ſpeak not here, as was ſaid; opinion of Merit, of Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, of the Worſhip of God, being abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, by the reaſon of the Inſtitution here profeſſed, the form of Service appointed by the Church, recommendeth the difference of dayes, to our devotions. And though we come not near the ſtrictneſſe of Abſtinence, wherewith in the Primitive Church they were wont to afflict themſelves, (and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps for very good reaſons we come not near it) yet to aſſemble for the Publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God (even in thoſe places, where there is not opportunity to Aſſemble every day, as you ſaw it was practiſed in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue) to abſtain till theſe Aſſemblies be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſetting aſide the favour we lend our own eaſe, muſt needs appear moſt commendable. I cannot ſay that this Inſtitution in reſpect of ſet dayes for Faſting, hath found ſo good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for the particular in the Reformed Churches: the generall reaſon is thus ſet down by Melanchthon, among chief Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, Apol.

Hence come the Feſtivals of the Nativity, Eaſter, Pentecoſt, and the like. This is that which Epiphanius ſaith, That Traditions were ordained for policies ſake, that is, for Orders ſake, and that ſuch Order might put men in mind of the ſtory and benefits of Chriſt. For marks of things, painted, as it were, in Rites and Cuſtomes, are much more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall to put the vulgar in mind, then wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</hi> Now the difference of ancient be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſeverall Churches, in the point of Publick Service, upon Feſtivall and Faſting-dayes,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:169390:149"/> is that which Epiphanius remembred afore, that the Aſſemblies upon Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes and Fridayes were held all Faſting till three after noon: and Tertullian, ſo long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, <hi>De Jejun.

The
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:169390:151"/> practice of them that celebrated and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Euchariſt every day, ſtandeth upon the example of the Primitive Chriſtians at Jeruſalem. Of whom when it is ſaid, that <hi>they continued conſtant in the doctrine of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and communion, and in breaking bread, and prayers;</hi> and that, <hi>continuing with one mind in the Temple, and from houſe to houſe, they did eat their meat with gladneſſe, and ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart:</hi> to what purpoſe ſhall we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that Breaking bread, and Communion is mentioned, beſides the Service of the Temple, but to ſignifie the Service of the Euchariſt, proper to the Faith of Chriſtians, in which they communicated among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as with the Jews in the Service of the Temple? knowing that at the firſt it was u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at meals (as it was inſtituted) among Chriſtians. This notwithſtanding, in other places, it ſeemeth the Euchariſt was celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but upon Lords dayes, as well in the times of the Apoſtles, as in the Church that ſucceeded. Acts xx. 7. <hi>On the first day of the week, the Diſciples being aſſembled to break bread;</hi> that is, <hi>to celebrate the Euchariſt,</hi> as the Syriack tranſlateth it. Here the firſt day of the week ſeemeth to ſtand againſt the reſt, in terms of difference, as if upon other dayes they did it not. And that is the day which S. Paul appointeth the Church of Corinth, as he had done the Churches of Galatia, to
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:169390:151"/> make their Collections for the poore, which Tertullian ſheweth was done at their Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, 1. Cor. xvi. 2. Tertull. Apolog.

Juſtice Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, for certain, mentioneth no other Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of Chriſtians, but on the Lords day, in the place aforenamed. And in the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Apoſtles ii. 58. where he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth to Aſſemble every day morning and evening, as was ſaid afore, the Euchariſt is mentioned to be celebrated but upon Lords dayes, as it followeth afterwards. Plinie's words in that place, are theſe at large, Epiſt. xcvii. l. x. <hi>Quòd eſſent ſoliti ſtato die ante lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem convenire, carménque Christo quaſi Deo dicere ſecum invicem; ſéque Sacramento, non in ſcelus aliquod obstringere, ſed nè furta, nè la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trocinia, nè adulteria committerent, nè fidem fallerent, nè depoſitum appellati abnegarent.

And that ſo it was celebrated, not onely under the Apoſtle, as <hi>Acts</hi> xx. 11. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. or under Ignatius, but in Juſtine Martyr and Tertullians time, appeareth by their words.

Which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, nothing hindereth, but the ſame might be practiſed in the Apoſtles time, and remembred in the Scriptures. To which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion I rather incline. Otherwiſe, whence ſhould the Cuſtome riſe, in Juſtine and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullians time, to celebrate the Euchariſt at their Morning Aſſemblies, when it was ſtill in uſe at Supper time, in their Feaſts of Love? That is it which Ignatius calleth <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, in the ancient tranſlation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged elſewhere, tranſlated, <hi>Agapam facere,</hi> in that which is extant, <hi>Miſſam facere,</hi> which he ſaith, muſt not be held without the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and that muſt be in reſpect of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt. And when Juſtine and Tertullian affirm, that it was frequented at meals, we muſt needs underſtand it, in the firſt place, of thoſe meals to which they aſſembled for the exerciſe of Chriſtian Charity and the Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God, as we ſee in Tertullian, <hi>Apol. c.</hi> 39. where if we find nothing of celebrating the Euchariſt, it is to be attributed to Caſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders reaſon, becauſe it was not his purpoſe to make known the faſhion of the Euchariſt
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:169390:153"/> to unbelievers, which might bring it into contempt among them. Plinie's words al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged ſeem to import, that the Chriſtians of his time Aſſembled twice on Lords dayes, before day, and at night. Before day, to praiſe Chriſt as God, and to tye them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon a Sacrament, or Oath, to make good what they profeſſed. I have not yet found that they were wont to make any ſuch formall Oath to themſelves, and muſt think it ſtrange, that they ſhould renew it at all ſolemn Aſſemblies; and therefore do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that his meaning concerneth the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Euchariſt, which of its own nature, we know, is an obligation to ſuch purpoſe. At night when they met to eat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it hath been ſhewed that the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt was celebrated. And ſo Plinie's words import the ſame that Juſtines, in which he deſcribeth to us the celebration of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt at ſolemn Morning Service, and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where at meals, among which the Feaſts of Love had the firſt place; and both of them the ſame that the Apoſtle in this place. His meaning in the xi. Chapter is not to abrogate thoſe Feaſts of Love, but to take a courſe that they might be held in common, for the exerciſe of Chriſtian Charity, and the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Service of God. Therefore if any man pretended the neceſſities of nature, he giveth him leave to eat at home, xi. 34. becauſe it
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:169390:153"/> hath appeared, that theſe Aſſemblies were held towards night, and that (when the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the world was to entertain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) then they Aſſembled to this ſober and Chriſtian refreſhment. But in this xiiii. Chapter he hath touched all the parts of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Service at ſolemn Aſſemblies, Prayers, the Praiſes of God, the Reading and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding of the Scriptures: And therefore when he ſaith, verſ. 16. <hi>Elſe when thou ſhalt</hi> BLESSE <hi>with the Spirit, how ſhall he that occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieth the room of the unlearned ſay Amen at thy</hi> GIVING OF THANKS? my purpoſe is to ſhew, that he referreth to the celebration of the Euchariſt in particular, and that Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving which from the beginning it was conſecrated with: to which purpoſe I have premiſed theſe probabilities, that the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt was then celebrated at their Morning Aſſemblies. In the mean time, it is plain by the Rubrick of our Service, which ſaith, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the Holy dayes, if there be no Communion, ſhall be ſaid,—</hi>with that which followeth; and more plain by the Rubrick of the firſt edition of Edward VI. after the Exhortation, which ſaith, <hi>In Cathedrall Churches, or other places, where there is daily Communion—,</hi> and again, <hi>And if upon the Sunday or Holy day the people be negligent to come to the Communion—,</hi> that our Reformers affected the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentation of this Service, according to the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:169390:154"/> Primitive practice, ſo farre as they thought it attainable.

Where let me have leave to ſay, That it had been much more for the edification of the Church to have laboured in reducing this pious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of our Reformers into practice, then to contend about ſaying that part of the Service, (which nevertheleſſe, as ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, never properly belonged to the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of that Sacrament) at the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the miniſtring of it.</p>

               <p>OF the Rites, and Circumſtances, and Ceremonies of Gods Service in Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick, it concerneth to ſay ſomething here, where we are about thé generall Order of it: and yet, ſo much hath been ſaid of it, and to ſo good purpoſe, that he that would come
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:169390:154"/> down to the particulars of it, ſhall be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſay over what hath been ſaid again. My purpoſe is to diſcourſe in few words, the reaſon and ground upon which in generall it is expedient, that the form of Publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ſhould be Solemn and Ceremonious, according to the method hitherto uſed. And that is this, which I touched afore: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Rule of the Apoſtle commandeth theſe things to be done both in Order and with Comelineſſe; and nothing can become the Service of God, but that which ſerveth to ſtirre up, and to exerciſe the inward reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the heart in our ſelves, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it in others. What that is, common reaſon muſt be judge, according to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. Here therefore lieth an appeal to the Common reaſon of all the world, not to the particular reaſons of perſons intereſſed in prejudice, Whether that inward Reverence and Devotion of the heart, wherein the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God conſiſteth, the exerciſe and maintenance of it do not require that it be in the Circumſtances and Rites of it Solemn and Ceremonious? Ask the world to what purpoſe the chief Actions of it are transacted with ſo much obſervance in Circumſtances, but to procure and maintain that reſpect which the publick good requireth they ſhould poſſeſſe in mens minds. In the State of Princes, in the Courts of Judgement, in
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:169390:155"/> Military matters, in the paſſage of all publick matters of any conſequence, common ſenſe is able to tell us what reſpect and obſervance is uſed, and all reaſon alloweth the neceſſity of it: For by this means is conveyed into the minds of the greateſt part of people, that reverence, in which the publick good requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all men to hold thoſe powers by which theſe great matters are managed; which it is not poſſible ſhould make impreſſions upon groſſe minds, by conviction of reaſon, were they not managed by their ſenſes. God hath made Chriſtians, though governed by the Spirit of his Grace, as groſſe in their bodily ſenſes and faculties of their minds, as other men of like education are: and it is a debt which the Guides of the Church owe to the wiſe and unwiſe of Gods people, to conduct them in the way of godlineſſe by means pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to their faculties. The outward form of Publick Service availeth much, even with them whoſe minds are leaſt in tune, to corroborate their reverence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion at the Service of God, by the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of it: but ſpeaking of them whoſe minds are leſſe withdrawn from their ſenſes, how great impreſſion ſhall the example of the world, practiſing the Service of God in an orderly and reverent form, make in the minds of men that cannot receive it from their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but from their ſenſes? This effect in
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:169390:155"/> things of ſlight conſequence in particular, which nevertheleſſe, altogether, amount to a conſiderable ſumme, is better ſeen by the groſſe in practice, then convinced by retail in diſpute: yet ſince the importunities of men have cauſed falſe reaſons to prevail with weak people, it is requiſite the true reaſons be pleaded, leſt it be thought there are none ſuch, becauſe not ſo fit to be pleaded. The Circumſtances and Ceremonies of Publick Service is indeed a kind of Diſcipline and Paedagogie, whereby men ſubject to ſenſe are guided in the exerciſe of godlineſſe: It is, as it were, the apparell of Religion at the heart; which ſome think, like the Sunne, moſt beautifull when it is moſt naked; and ſo it were indeed, did men conſiſt of minds alone without bodies, but as long as our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſenſes are manageable to our ſouls ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, the heat within will ſtarve without this apparell without. And therefore, under better judgement, I hold it requiſite, that the obſervance of Rites and Ceremonies in the Publick Service of God, ſhould increaſe and become more ſolemn after the world was come into the Church, then under the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting times of it. Perſecution was like Antiperiſtaſis in nature, in preſerving Order and reverence in the Publick Offices of the Church, with the reſpect of thoſe Guides that ruled it. But ſince the Net of the Goſpel
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:169390:156"/> hath been caſt in the Ocean, and caught good and bad, it is more requiſite that all ſhould paſſe, as under rule and obſervance, ſo in the moſt reverent form, that the coldneſſe and indifference of the worſer part appear not to debauch the good diſpoſition of others. Though from the beginning, as early as the records of the Church are able to inform us, we are ſure it was never without ſuch out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward obſervances, as according to the ſtate of the time, tended to maintain, to witneſſe the diſpoſition of the heart anſwerable. The Apoſtles ordinance of Praying and Singing Pſalmes, men with heads bare, women with heads covered, the Salutation of Peace ſo long practiſed in the Primitive Church, from the time of the Apoſtles, Impoſition of hands in divers Acts of Publick Service, ſignifying the overſhadowing of the Holy Ghoſt, and Gods hand ſtretched out to give the bleſſing for which Prayer was made, and without queſtion derived from the times of the Apoſtles, are of this nature. And it is thought that when the Apoſtles ſpeak of putting off the old man, and putting on the new, <hi>Col.</hi> iii. 9, 10. ii. 11. of burying in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme, <hi>Col.</hi> ii. 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> vi. 4. of the unction of grace, 1. <hi>John</hi> ii. 20, 27. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> ii. 21. alluſion is made to ſome Rites of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Offices, uſed even at that time.

But that ſhall be counted decent with us, that ſhall ſo fit the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of holy Myſteries, as may be a competent exerciſe unto godlineſſe; or which at leaſt may conduce to ornament ſuitable to the action: and that, not without benefit, but to put the faithfull in mind with how much modeſty and religious obſervance they ought to be converſant in ſacred actions.</hi> What this in generall importeth, is that which I deſire in the particular heads. Times and Places are no way ſanctified o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then as they are deputed to the Service of God. The words of our Lord in the Goſpel, Matth. xxiii. 18. <hi>Which is the greater, the Sacrifice, or the Altar that ſanctifieth it?</hi> point out to us a difference betwixt the Law and the Goſpel in this particular. For, as S. Hierome ſaid afore, That the Service
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:169390:157"/> of God in Spirit and Truth, proper to the DISPENSATION of the Goſpel, is acceptable to God at all times, that all dayes are equall of themſelves, no difference between them, but in reſpect to the Aſſemblies of Chriſtians upon them, and the work of thoſe Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies: ſo is it to be ſaid with truth concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Places, to make it a generall obſervation and a true one, That under the Law, the Time and the Place ſanctified the Service confined to it; but under the Goſpel, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice required ſanctifieth the Time and Place of it. For example, The Paſſeover on the due time was holy, on another time had been abominable: Dwelling in Tabernacles, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded on ſuch a day of ſuch a moneth, uſed otherwiſe, no part of Gods Service, but ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge in uſurping it: The Sacrifices where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of our Lord ſpeaketh, holy upon the Altar, otherwhere abominable. On the other ſide, the Service of Chriſtians being good by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and acceptable to God at all Times and in all Places, hath a ſpeciall promiſe of God from the unity of the Church, and the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies in it. Which becauſe they cannot be held without publick Order, confining them to Times and Places, thereupon thoſe Times and Places, which are capable of no Holineſſe in themſelves, are nevertheleſſe truly qualified HOLY, as an attribute derived from the holineſſe of thoſe actions to which
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:169390:158"/> they are deſigned. Which may well be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a relative, or metonymicall Holineſſe. Thus are Times and Places conſecrated, by being appointed to the Service of God: Places, as more ſubject to ſenſe, by the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of that appointment; that is, by the Prayers of the Church, miniſtred by the Guides of it. But in as much as it behoveth, that the Service which ſhall be acceptable to God, be done in the unity of his Church, and that which is ſo done, muſt be according to publick Order, confining the Times and Places of Aſſemblies: hereupon, thoſe Times and Places which are capable of no Holineſſe but that which is aſcribed to them, in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that work whereunto they are aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, give Holineſſe to that work again, in as much as if it be done in oppoſition to that publick Order in which the unity of the Church conſiſteth, it is abominable afore God. He that hath promiſed to be preſent where we are Aſſembled, by the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath promiſed to be abſent where we are divided: let them look to themſelves that cauſe it, thoſe that do not, have no cauſe to doubt of Gods preſence. This is the ground of that reſpect which is due to the Times and Places of Gods Service, and which, if it go not beyond the conſideration here expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, cannot prove ſuperſtitious. The Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of that work which differenceth them,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:169390:158"/> requireth they be ſo uſed as may conduce moſt to ſtirre and maintain the right appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of that work in our own minds, and to convay it to others. If the dayes of our Aſſemblies be imployed upon ordinary bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, no marvel if the mind prove not at leiſure to attend the work for which they are deſigned. Churches are ſtill more ſubject to ſenſe then dayes are, and the common uſe of them, common reaſon and experience will prove to breed a common eſteem of the work of Gods Service, and in conſequence, of the Majeſty that owneth it. If we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that God is there preſent to accept the Service of our Aſſemblies, we cannot refuſe to acknowledge reſpect due there in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, though we referre our ſelves to Law, or commendable Cuſtome, for the particular of it. That which is to be ſaid for the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Veſture, in ſolemnizing the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, is much to this purpoſe. The meaning of it is, to procure inward reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to that work which it maketh out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ſolemn; to repreſent to our own apprehenſions, and to convay to other mens, the due reſpect and eſteem which it ought to bear in our hearts. And common reaſon, and all experience juſtifieth this intent. For all the actions of eſteem in the world are ſet forth with the like ſolemnities; to no other purpoſe, but to convay by the ſenſes to the
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:169390:159"/> mind that reſpect which they ought to bear. And the world hath tried enough, that thoſe which have made it part of their Religion to ſtick ſcorn upon ſuch ſlight Circumſtances, have made it, no leſſe, to deface and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace the ſubſtance of Gods Publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. As for the difference of bodily Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures at the Service of God, that is ſtill a more conſiderable mean to procure and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that eſteem and reſpect of it, for which I plead. The words of S. Auguſtine of the Geſtures of Prayer are remarkable, <hi>De Cura pro Mort. C.</hi> v. which, he ſaith, are not uſed ſo much to lay the mind open to God, to whom the moſt inviſible inclinations of the heart are beſt known, as to ſtirre up a mans own mind to pray with more humble and fervent grones. And then it followeth, <hi>Et neſcio quomodo, cùm hi motus corporis fieri niſi animi motu praecedente non poſsint, eiſdem rur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus exteriùs viſibiliter factis, ille interior invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilis qui eos fecit, augetur: ac per hoc cordis affectus, qui ut fierent iſta praeceſsit, quia facta ſunt, creſcit. And I know not how, though theſe bodily motions are not done without the motion of the mind going afore, yet again, by the outward viſible doing of them, that inward and inviſible one which cauſeth them, increaſeth: and ſo, the affection of the heart, antecedent to the doing of theſe, by the doing of them gathereth ſtrength.</hi> Chriſtians have bodies as other men have,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:169390:159"/> and though the Service of God conſiſt in the inward intention of the mind, and the devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpirit which performeth it, yet this bruit part of us is able to contribute ſo farre towards it, as it refreſheth in our ſelves, and expreſſeth to others the inward motions wherein it conſiſteth. It is an impreſſion of Nature that teacheth all people thus to actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, thus to animate the Service they tender to God: and experience ſhall tell them that obſerve it, That where it is paſſed over with indifference, there men behave themſelves more as hearers then actours in it; there, as the naturall heat at the heart, ſo the inward heat of devotion, which ought to dwell there, ſtifleth and choketh for want of this airing and exerciſe. Thus that which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the intention of the mind in private, multiplieth it in publick, and propagateth in others that which it cheriſheth in our ſelves. Beſides that, it contributeth towards the comelineſſe of ſuch Aſſemblies, if it be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. To good purpoſe it was a Deacons office in the Primitive Church to put the people in mind of theſe obſervances, at leaſt in great congregations. But in this whole matter of Rites and Ceremonies in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Service, there is Caution to be uſed, with which (though in the latitude of their nature indifferent) they will prove an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to it; and without which, they may
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:169390:160"/> prove an offenſe in it. For the nature and kind of that which is done, reſpect is to be had to the end propoſed. If the particular obſerved be not, according to reaſon, a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance apt to procure, to maintain in our ſelves, to expreſſe and convay to others, that intention and reverence which the Service of God requireth, for what cauſe ſhall we ſay it is obſerved? Shall it be thought accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God alone of it ſelf, without reference to the due end and purpoſe? Then muſt it needs turn to a voluntary obſervance, wherein we diſcharge our ſelves to God, in ſtead of the Service he requireth. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, thoſe that are not offenſive for their kind, for their number may prove no leſſe. For, as the ſuckers that grow under great ſtocks, where there are too many, intercept that ſap that ſhould nouriſh the trees to bear fruit: ſo, where the Circumſtances and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of Publick Service are multiplied beyond meaſure, there the mind, diſtracted into a number of outward obſervations, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not allow that intention to the Subſtance, which it ſpendeth upon the Circumſtance. And ſo it falleth out as afore, they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for their own ſake, as acceptable to God of themſelves, without reſpect of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing that Service which he requireth. Laſt, becauſe it hath been ſhewed, that Order as well as Comelineſſe is the Rule to direct
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:169390:160"/> the form of Gods Publick Service; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, without Order, nothing becometh it, though with Order apt to become it, that which hath been ſaid, is to be underſtood of thoſe Rites and Ceremonies which Publick Order inforceth, that is, which are either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned by Law, or practiſed by Cuſtome which it alloweth: As for the voluntary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of particular perſons, they are by their nature ſubject to abuſe, as is to be ſeen in the Superſtitions of the Church of Rome, which all reaſon ſheweth had their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the well-meant devotions of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons. And therefore it is plain, that they may prove a juſt ſubject of that offenſe to the weak, which the Apoſtle forbiddeth; which thoſe that are practiſed upon Publick Orders, declaring the due meaning of them, cannot, as my purpoſe is now to declare: becauſe it is an objection, which if it take place, as ſome think, muſt needs overthrow the moſt part of that which hath been ſaid to the Order and Circumſtances of Publick Service. It is to be known that there were two ſorts of Jewiſh Chriſtians under the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, according to the difference of whom, both their doctrine and practice, eſpecially of S. Paul, is to be valued. For, on the one ſide, the Apoſtles, in the Councel at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, ordered, <hi>Acts</hi> xv. 20. that thoſe which were converted from the Gentiles, ſhould
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:169390:161"/> abſtain from things dying in the bloud, and ſacrificed to Idoles. S. Paul circumciſed Timotheus, xvi. 3. purified himſelf accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Law, xxi. 26. In reſpect to the ſame ſort, he is bold to ſay, Rom. xii. 6. <hi>He that regardeth a day, regardeth it to the Lord, and he that regardeth not a day, regardeth it not to the Lord: He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks, and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.</hi> And that, it ſeemeth, upon the conſideration that followeth in the next words, becauſe, though not without blame, for the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their freedome, yet living and dying to the Lord, they had a pious intention in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, to excuſe their defect in particular. But in regard to the other ſort, it is the ſame Apoſtle that ſaith, Gal. iiii. 10, 11. <hi>Ye ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve dayes, and moneths, and times, and years. I am afraid of you, leſt I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.</hi> And, Coloſſ. ii. 16. <hi>Let no man therefore judge you in meat or drink, or in reſpect of a Feaſt, or New-moon, or Sabbath:</hi> expreſſing further what he meaneth, when he ſaith, <hi>Let no man judge you,</hi> verſ. 5. <hi>Beware leſt any man ſpoil you.</hi> and verſ. 20. <hi>Why as living in the world are you ſubject to Ordinances, touch not, taſt not, handle not?</hi> And to Titus i. 10 <hi>There are many unruly and vain talkers, and deceivers, eſpecially they of the Circumciſion, whoſe mouthes muſt be ſtopped.</hi> And wherein,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:169390:161"/> he expreſſeth, verſ. 15. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the clean all things are clean:</hi> Shewing that they were not to be tolerated but oppoſed in that which they taught, of differences of times, and meats, according to the Law of Moſes. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his practice in Titus, whereof Gal. ii. 34. <hi>But neither Titus who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumciſed; and that becauſe of falſe brethren, ſlily foiſting in, that came in privily to ſpie out our freedome which we have in Chriſt Jeſus, that they might bring us into bondage.</hi> This difference in the Apoſtles practice and doctrine muſt needs proceed from the difference of perſons they had to do with. The one, like men that were new come out of the dark, could not look right upon the light of that freedome which the Goſpel eſtateth, and not ſatisfied of the right of Chriſtians, for their particular pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, made a conſcience of dayes and meats according to the Law. The other, renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their freedome, and in love with their own ſervitude, took upon them to dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize and maintain the neceſſity of ſuch obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, upon thoſe deſperate conſequences which the Apoſtle expreſſeth. Thoſe are the weak, and theſe the ſtrong, according to the Apoſtle; becauſe, though for reaſon, weakeſt, (for a falſe opinion is a further weakneſſe then a doubt of the truth) yet for will, moſt reſolute to ſtand in it. Thoſe in
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:169390:162"/> action doubtfull, theſe in opinion erroneous. Theſe are the men whom the Apoſtle char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth by the Law of Love not to ſcandalize; ſhewing that in two things it might be done: Firſt, Rom. xiv. 15. <hi>If thy Brother be grieved with thy meat, then walkeſt thou not charitably; deſtroy not him with thy meat for whom Chriſt died.</hi> Which Origen conceiveth to point at ſuch as took diſtaſt at the Profeſſion of Chriſt, ſo as to forſake it, upon occaſion of ſuch ſlight offenſes: And the vehemence of thoſe terms which the Apoſtle uſeth ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to import no leſſe. But by the words of the Apoſtle, verſ. 15. <hi>If thy Brother be</hi> GRIEVED <hi>with thy meat.</hi> and verſ. 10. <hi>Why</hi> JUDGEST <hi>thou thy Brother? why ſetteſt thou thy Brother at nought?</hi> it appeareth, that all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of theſe weak ones, is, in the ſenſe of the Apoſtle, a degree of this offenſe. But there is another expreſſed, <hi>verſ.</hi> 22, 23. That whereas it behoveth all men to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved of what they do, that it is acceptable to God, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. by the indiſcreet example of one that underſtood his own freedome, he that did not, might be moved to uſe it with a doubtfull conſcience, which the Apoſtle declareth to be ſinne. By the way, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe whereof the Apoſtle writeth, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> viii. 9. x. 27. is of another nature, not perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to this purpoſe; for here the offenſe is an example that moveth a man to do that
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:169390:162"/> which is lawfull, with a doubtfull conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: there, it is an example which moveth a man to do that which is unlawfull, with an erroneous conſcience, that is to ſay, when the example of him that hath knowledge, eating that which was ſacrificed unto Idoles, without difference, moveth the ſimple to participate in the worſhip of Idoles by feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on their Sacrifices. Thus it is ſuppoſed that offenſe is given to the weak by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of this Church, when thoſe that are not ſatisfied in the things ordered, either take diſtaſt thereupon at the Church, and the Communion of it, or are moved by example to do that which is ordered, with a doubtfull conſcience. Where it muſt be excepted, that no man can uſe this argument of ſcandall to the weak, but he muſt acknowledge the things ordered to be lawfull. For the weak, whom the Apoſtle forbiddeth to offend, is he that is not perſwaded of the lawfulneſſe of that which is lawfull indeed. Beſides, he that pretendeth the ſcandall of the weak, by example moving to proceed upon a doubtfull conſcience, is not ſubject to that kind of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe. For, in that he complaineth, he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he is aware enough of the danger: And it is without the compaſſe of common ſenſe to imagine, that a man ſhould ſtumble in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the example againſt which he profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. In fine, the oppoſition made to publick
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:169390:163"/> Order, and that which it injoyneth, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence enough, that they are not the weak but the ſtrong, not the doubtfull but the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous, (weak in reaſon, but ſtrong in will, or, as it was once well ſaid, headſtrong in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing without reaſon what Order preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth) not thoſe whom the Apoſtle chargeth to forbear, but thoſe whom he forbeareth not a moment, <hi>Gal.</hi> ii. 5. whom he chargeth the Coloſſians and Titus not to forbear, that we have to deal with. The matters were light wherein their offenſe ſtuck, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence which oppoſition drew, involved the ſubſtance of the Goſpel. So are the things ſlight which we ſtick at, but publick Order, which dependeth upon the right of preſcribing, and the edification of the Church, intended in the particulars, deſerve not to be abandoned for an unjuſt offenſe. True it is, that a private perſon, that will be charitable, muſt forbear the uſe of his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which no Rule confineth, when he ſeeth it will be offenſe to the weak; if he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear it not, he giveth juſt offenſe according to the Apoſtle. And it is to be thought, that under the countenance and wing of the erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and ſtrong, there walk divers of thoſe doubtfull and weak, to whom reſpect is to be had, according to the Apoſtle. But if the queſtion thereupon be made, Whether it be expedient for the Church to Order ſuch
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:169390:163"/> things as ſhall ſeem to advantage the Form, the Order, the Rites of Divine Service, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be expedient for thoſe whom it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth to obſerve and exact the ſame, in caſe there may be doubtfull Conſciences that may take offenſe? The anſwer will be Yes, even according to the Apoſtle: becauſe otherwiſe the publick Order, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendeth, can by no means be preſerved in the Church, ſince it is not poſſible ſo to order things of this nature, as to leave no poſſible doubt in any Conſcience. Might not thoſe of the Gentiles, whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles enjoyned to forbear things dying in their bloud, and offered to Idoles, have taken offenſe, becauſe they were confined in the juſt uſe of their freedome? Or the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, that S. Paul ſuffered not their women to ſit with bare faces at publick Service? as the Virgins of Tertullians time profeſſed themſelves ſcandalized at thoſe of their rank that practiſed it. Suppoſe the Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay as the Apoſtles, <hi>It ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt, and to us:</hi> S. Paul in the other caſe proceedeth upon no other reaſons then ſuch as the Church muſt now uſe in like ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. And I ſuppoſe, the Preſident inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt, authorizeth the Church to proceed in like matters, though not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending immediate inſpirations. Laſt of all, Who can doubt, but among the erroneous of
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:169390:164"/> them that did Judaize under the Apoſtles, there were alſo of the doubtfull and weak led away with their pretenſes? And yet we ſee the Apoſtle <hi>forbeareth them not a moment,</hi> in reſpect to the weak. All this containing no more inconvenience then this, That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as all men are bound to indeavour them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſatisfie and overcome ſuch doubts of their Conſcience, the Apoſtles oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on redoubleth a new obligation to do it, leſt they offend this Miniſtery, if they do it not. So doth the Conſtitution of the Church adde a new obligation of reſolving doubtfull Conſciences, for fear of offending the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Order which it ſettleth. And in all this I ſuppoſe there is no juſt offenſe. For, as there is alwayes means in the Church, with ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to overcome doubts of Conſciences; ſo is there no means to procure that there ſhall be no doubts of Conſcience in the Church, ſo long as there are unperfect Chriſtians in it. But he whom it concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to obſerve or exact publick Order, muſt not give juſt offenſe to publick Order and all that go by it, by neglecting it, for fear of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving unjuſt offenſe to private perſons by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving or exacting it.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>BEing now to compare the Form of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which we uſe with that of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, and to derive both from the practice pointed out to us in thoſe particulars which are remembred in the Scriptures, I am to profeſſe at the beginning, that my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:169390:165"/> is not to be extended to the particulars of words or conceptions wherein it is couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: It will be enough to reduce the main ſubſtance and order of it to that which we find practiſed under the Apoſtles. My buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe therefore is, to deſcribe the moſt anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and generall Form of that Solemn Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which was uſed when the Euchariſt was celebrated, not out of the Liturgies extant alone, but out of the Teſtimonies of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Eccleſiaſticall writers concurring. For it ſhall appear that from hence is derived, and herein is contained, firſt, the Order of daily Morning and Evening Service, then the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanies, appointed beſides for Lords-dayes, Wedneſdayes and Fridayes; and laſt, the Celebration of the Euchariſt, which is all, or almoſt all that which this Diſcourſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to compriſe. In the firſt place it is to be known, that from the firſt times of the Church there were alwayes two parts of Publick Service: At the one all perſons might be preſent, though not Chriſtians; till the Sermon was done, the Church-doores were open and free: But when they went to celebrate the Euchariſt, then all Hearers or Catechumeni, (that is, thoſe that were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be inſtructed in the Faith, but were not as yet admitted to Baptiſme) all that were under Penance, all poſſeſſed with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean ſpirits were diſmiſſed and ſhut out,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:169390:165"/> none ſuffered to be preſent but thoſe that were admitted to Communicate. Of theſe two parts we have ſufficient remembrance in Juſtine Martyr, the moſt ancient of Church-writers that remain unqueſtionable. His words are theſe, <hi>Apol.</hi> ii. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>As many as are perſwaded and believe thoſe things to be true which are taught and ſaid of us, and undertake to be able ſo to live, are taught to pray and deſire of God with Faſting, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of foregoing ſinnes, we alſo praying and faſting with them.</hi> For, what prayers were theſe whereof he ſpeaketh, but thoſe which we ſhall ſhew afterwards were wont to be made, as a part of their Service, on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Hearers (as alſo of Penitents, and perſons beſet with evil ſpirits) by themſelves and the Congregation both, immediately afore their departure? Afterwards, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>But we, having thus waſhed him that is perſwaded and agreed, bring him to thoſe that are called Brethren, where they are aſſembled to make Common-Prayers, both for themſelves, and for him that is baptiſed, and all</hi>
                  <pb n="320" facs="tcp:169390:166"/> 
                  <hi>men elſe every where, earneſtly.</hi> It ſhall appear in due time, that the Prayers of the Church for all ſtates of perſons in the Church, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after the Hearers were diſmiſſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore celebrating the Euchariſt. Therefore at them, onely the Brethren are preſent, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Hearers were at thoſe which were made for the forgiveneſſe of their ſinnes. That unbelievers were admitted to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at Preaching or Expounding the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, in the time of the Apoſtles, it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by S. Paul, 1. Cor. xiv. 24. <hi>But if all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie and there come in one that believeth not:</hi> That they were excluded at that time as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when the Euchariſt came to be ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated, I have not the like evidence, but in reaſon I muſt needs preſume it. Hereupon riſeth the difference between theſe which once were called the Firſt and Second Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: The ground whereof being taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in this ſtate of the Church, in which all are baptized Infants, and publick Penance for the greateſt part is unknown, nevertheleſſe that Service muſt needs remain the chief part of Gods publick Service which the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt is celebrated with; howſoever it come to paſſe, that the Euchariſt is not celebrated at the greateſt part of ſolemn Aſſemblies. This is remembred here upon occaſion of that Confeſſion of ſinnes which our Service beginneth with, as alſo the Service of almoſt
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:169390:166"/> all reformed Churches, in which it may be counted a generall order to begin with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſinnes. Which order Du Pleſſis laboureth to derive from the ancient practice of the Synagogue firſt, and conſequently of the Church Primitive, alledging to that purpoſe thoſe forms of Confeſſion over the ſacrifices, which P. Fagius hath produced from the Hebrew Doctours, upon Lev. xvi. 21. where the Law ſaith, <hi>And Aaron ſhall lay both his hands upon the head of the live Goat, and confeſſe over him all the iniquities of the children of Iſrael, and all their tranſgreſsions in their ſinnes:</hi> together with the words of Liranus upon that place, <hi>Sicut facimus in Confeſsione facta in principio Miſſae:</hi> As we do, ſaith he, in the Confeſſion which is made at the beginning of the Maſſe: As alſo the Authour de <hi>de Cardinal. Chriſti Operibus,</hi> among S. Cyprians works. <hi>Hierarcha pius, quem Spiritus ſ. compungit, excitat, inhabitat, &amp; ſanctificat,—confidenter orat pro ſua &amp; populi ignorantia, recolens pudibundi &amp; contriti ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi confeſsione, quòd aliquando, praevalente ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versùm ſe peccato, fuerit derelictus. The pious Biſhop, whom the H. Ghoſt pricketh, ſtirreth, inhabiteth, and ſanctifieth, prayeth confidently, for his own and the peoples ignorance, recalling in the Confeſsion of a mind aſhamed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite, that ſometime he hath been forſaken, ſinne prevailing againſt him.</hi> It is manifeſt indeed,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:169390:167"/> that this Confeſſion of ſinnes is uſed in the Breviarie, <hi>in Feriali officio ad Primam,</hi> as well as at the beginning of the Maſſe, in theſe words, <hi>Confiteor Deo omnipotenti—</hi>The people anſwering, <hi>Miſereatur tui omnipotens Deus, &amp; dimiſsis peccatis tuis, perducat te ad vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam aeternam.</hi> Which done, the people alſo make the like Confeſſion for their parts, the Miniſter anſwering the ſame. And this is the Confeſſion of ſinnes which is meant in the words of Liranus, and the Authour <hi>de Cardinalibus Christi operibus,</hi> though it is not probable that it paſſed in thoſe ſcandalous terms that follow, in his time. And this, in the Rubricks of the Maronites Miſſall, as it is printed at Rome, is called, Abſolving the Prieſt, by the people. But ſince ſacrifices are no part of the morall Service of God, and it hath been declared how Confeſſion of ſinnes was uſed in the Temple at that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Service, it ſeemeth impertinent here to conſider that which was done at offering Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices. As for the Service of the Primitive Church, at which unbelievers, and ſuch as onely pretended to Baptiſme, with thoſe that were under Penance, and the like, were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, This will be a conſtraining reaſon to prove, that no Confeſſion of ſinnes, no pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for Forgiveneſſe was made in common for them and all believers, at the beginning of Service, becauſe of the great diſtance of their
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:169390:167"/> eſtates and conditions in the Church, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this was the ſubject of thoſe Prayers, which Hearers &amp; Penitents were diſmiſſed with at the end of the firſt Service, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation joyning with them, and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop or Prieſt bleſſing them to that purpoſe, as muſt be ſaid afterwards. Therefore in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin Martyr and Tertullian, where they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe what was done at thoſe ſolemn Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, in the Conſtitutions of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles L. viii. which ſeems to be the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Form extant, and in moſt of the Greek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Liturgies, there is no Confeſſion of ſinnes at the beginning. And therefore it may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeem to have been put there, after that the difference of firſt and ſecond Service came to be obſerved rather for faſhions ſake, and remembrance of the ancient cuſtome, then for the originall reaſon, when the world was become Chriſtian, and the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween hearers and the reſt aboliſhed. In the beginning of the copie which they give us of the Ancient Spaniſh Courſe, called the <hi>moſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabe</hi> or <hi>muſtarabe,</hi> there is this Rubrick; <hi>Factâ priùs Confeſsione, uti fit in Miſs is Latinis, juxta uſum Toletanum antiquum, dicitur Introitus to qui ſequitur modo. Confeſsion firſt being made, as in Latine Maſſes, according to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient uſe of Toledo, the Introit is ſaid in manner following.</hi> As if this Confeſſion were proper to the Latine Service, in oppoſition to the
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:169390:168"/> Greekiſh. Which notwithſtanding in that which is intitled to S. James, he that cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brateth, maketh Confeſſion of his ſinnes, praying for pardon, to the purpoſe that his Service in celebrating the Euchariſt may be accepted: which originally when no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made of the Euchariſt at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, being kept private from the unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, could not have been. That which is now at the beginning of the Maſſe, by the ſtuff is diſcovered to be of later date, being as ſcandalous a paſſage, as any in all the Maſſe beſides, when he ſayes, <hi>Confiteor Deo Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potenti, B. Mariae ſemper Virgini, B. Micha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cli Archangelo, B. Joanni Baptiſtae, SS. Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis Petro &amp; Paulo, B. N. Omnibus SS. &amp; vobis Fratres, quia peccavi nimis, cogitatione, verbo, &amp; opere.</hi> This is not to ſay that Confeſſion of ſinnes is not fit for the beginning of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, I mean nothing leſſe, as ſhall be ſaid af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards: But that it is not derived from the generall and originall Form of publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the Church, for reaſons proper to that time. The example of S. Baſils Monks, and their morning Service, deſcribed by him <hi>Ep. lxiii.</hi> ſeemeth more pertinent to be made the preſident of ours. His words are theſe, <gap reason="foreign">

As alſo that Confeſſion of ſinnes which we ſpake of in the Breviary, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſcandalous for the ſtuff, ſeemeth to have been uſed to the ſame purpoſe with ours, and that of other Reformed Churches, for a preparation and entrance to Morning Service. Now becauſe it hath been ſhewed afore, that this ſolemn Service of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of Pſalmes of Gods praiſes, of reading the Scripture and expounding it, of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayers, and the celebration of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, that which remaineth here to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared is this, in what Form and Order theſe materials were practiſed, according to the eldeſt and moſt generall cuſtome of the Church which we ſhall be able to diſcern. The Order of reading the Scriptures is this, according to the Conſtitutions of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ii. 57. having reckoned the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures of the Old Teſtament, to be read in Churches, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. <hi>Being returned back to the Divine Altar, he beginneth the holy melodie of the Pſalmes, all ranks of the Church ſinging with him thoſe holy Pſalmes: after, follows in conſequence, the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the holy Scriptures by the Miniſters.</hi> In this Form, which he deſcribes, there is no interlacing of Pſalmes and Leſſons, but the Pſalmes firſt, and afterwards the reading of the Scriptures. Of the Churches of Africk and their cuſtome, we may preſume from S. Auguſtine. His Sermons make divers
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:169390:169"/> times mention of a Leſſon firſt out of the Prophets, then out of the Epiſtles and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels, with a Pſalme or Pſalmes between them: And in his Sermon he expounds them all ſometimes. In the Maſſe it ſelf, there remains ſomething of this cuſtome, as brief and ſhort as they have made it. To compare it with the Form deſcribed afore in part out of the <hi>Conſtitutions,</hi> and for the reſt to be deſcribed, it is ſtrange to ſee to what a ſmall modell they have reduced it. Whether it were, becauſe it was framed for thoſe times and places, where Morning Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was uſed beſides, for which reaſon they thought good to abbridge it, retaining ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe the ſubſtantiall parts of publick Service: Or whether out of a deſire of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying private Maſſes, it was ſo made on purpoſe for ſpeed: Or whether ſo it were alwayes in the Latine Church, and we are to believe thoſe copies which they give us of the Ambroſian Service, and that of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarabe or Spaniſh to be of any great time, (indeed the Order of Leſſons ſaid to be compoſed by S. Hierome, &amp; of Antiphones by S. Gregory, and other Forms of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Church, are all very ſhort) This not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, in the Introit we ſee the trace of that ſinging of Pſalmes in the beginning, of which Dionyſius: And the Graduall, as they call it, which is the ſhred of a Pſalme
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:169390:170"/> between the Epiſtle and the Goſpel, is in the ſame place with that Pſalme between thoſe Leſſons whereof S. Auguſtine ſpeakes. In the pattern of the Ambroſian Service for Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſſe day, which we have out of the Miſſall of the Church of Millain, there is firſt a Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon out of the Prophets, a ſecond out of the Epiſtles, and the laſt out of the Goſpels, with verſicles of Pſalmes, or Hymns, or Antipho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes between each. Here, as concerning the Pſalmes in the Church, let me have leave to reſume that which was proved afore out of S. Paul, that the cuſtome was from the times of the Apoſtles, ſo to ſing them that the whole Congregation might bear a part in the praiſes of God, which the book of Pſalmes from time to time inviteth them to do. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly in the pretended Dionyſius, the Biſhop begins the Pſalmes, but all the ranks proceed to joyn in the ſame. But in the Conſtitutions of the Apoſtles, the people are to anſwer onely the Acroſtichs. What thoſe were I cannot better conjecture, then by the words of Philo, <hi>de vita Contempl.</hi> where he relates the faſhion of thoſe Hymnes which the Eſſenes by Alexandria in Egypt uſed at their Common Feaſts, which he ſaith were ſung firſt by the chief, afterwards by the reſt in their order, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>All hearing with much ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi>
                  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:169390:170"/> 
                  <hi>but when the ends and burdens of the Hymnes are to be ſung, for them all the men and women ſing out.</hi> Some ſuch thing I ſuppoſe it was, which in the Conſtitutions there is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>end. verſes</hi> of the Pſalmes, as the <hi>Gloria Patri</hi> among us, known to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at thoſe times, when for ſome inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence found of <hi>indecorum</hi> in performing this Office, the whole Congregation joyned no more in the Pſalmes. For though in the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of thoſe Churches, which Dionyſius deſcribeth, the people joyned in them, at thoſe times whereof he ſpeaketh, &amp; though I doubt not but thoſe Conſtitutions, &amp; the Canons of the Councel of Laodicea be more ancient then the pretended Dionyſius, yet by them it appeareth, that when the Conſtitutions direct the people to joyn in the cloſes, and when that Councel ordereth, <hi>Can.</hi> 15. that no more then the Canonicall ſingers (that is, inrolled in the liſt of the Church) that went up into the desk, &amp; ſung out of the Parchmine, ſhould ſing in the Church, there was by that time, and in thoſe places of the Church, inconvenience found in the Congregations joyning in it, for which cauſe it was referred to the Church-ſingers. Another courſe there was much uſed in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers parts of the Church, of ſinging the Pſalmes by Antiphones: Of which it ſhall not be requiſite here to repeat what is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:169390:171"/> of the firſt uſe of it, in the Eaſt under Ignatius, the coming of it into the Weſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der S. Ambroſe, the relation of S. Baſil, and the practice of his Monks, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> lxiii. the Order of Pope Celeſtine, for the Pſalmes to be ſung before the Euchariſt by way of Antiphones: It ſhall ſuffice to take notice here, that this was one of the wayes that were put in uſe, to the purpoſe that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation might joyn in the praiſes of God with moſt comlineſſe, according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the Apoſtles time. Of the Leſſons of the Scripture it muſt further be obſerved here, that the Ancient and Primitive Order of the Church ſeemeth to have intended them ſo large, that by hearing them read in the Church, they might become familiar even to the unlearned of the people, as Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus ſaid afore, that the Jews by hearing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes read in the Synagogues, became as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in their Laws, as a man is in telling his own name, whereas among other Nations, the ſimple never attain to know their own Laws. For you ſee how many Leſſons are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to be read in the Conſtitutions of the Apoſtles, two out of the Old Teſtament, out of the Acts, out of the Epiſtles, out of the Goſpels. Laſt of all, accordingly he reckoneth in particular the Books of the Old Teſtament to be read in the Church; as doth alſo the ſaid Councel of Laodicea in
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:169390:171"/> the laſt Canon, upon this occaſion repeat the liſt of holy Scriptures to be read in the Church: and Dionyſius expounding the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Church deſcribed by him afore, reckoneth the ſubject of all the particular Books in the Scriptures, which he ſaith are read after the Pſalmes, to inlarge with more ample declarations &amp; examples thoſe things which in the Pſalmes are but darkly and in brief pointed at. All which, I ſuppoſe, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates a great deal more then thoſe ſhort Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons picked out of ſome parts of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, as well for the Romane Miſſall, as other Liturgies extant. In that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to S. James, there is a remarkable Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick after the Angelicall Hymne, and the Prayer that follows it, which ſayes thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>After is read very largely the holy Oracles of the Old Teſtament, and the Prophets, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation of the Sonne of God is declared,—</hi>that is, the Goſpels are read. For hereby he gives us ſuſpicion enough to preſume, that the reading of the Scriptures was wont to be lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at the firſt then afterwards it became, when in the declining &amp; degenerating times of the Church, the increaſe of ſenſible Ceremonies and Obſervances began to crowd out the ſubſtantiall parts of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Service of God. For ſo there is
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:169390:172"/> cauſe to conceive by that of the Sermon, whereof it follows immediately there, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that is, <hi>After the Leſſons are read, and the Sermon is done.</hi> For in Juſtine Martyrs deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the Service in his time, after the reading of the Scriptures, follows immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately the Sermon to expound them, and to exhort the people to follow the doctrine. Tertullian ſpeaketh not of the order or place which the Sermon had in the Service, but remembreth it as a principall part of it. In the Conſtitutions of the Apoſtles the place was produced afore, wherein mention is made, after the reading of the Scriptures, of the Presbyters ſpeaking to the people one after another, and the Biſhop after them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Cuſtome derived from the Apoſtles time. The 18. Canon of Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>That after the Sermons of the Biſhops, firſt the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for the Hearers must be made apart.</hi> In fine, It is manifeſt by the Order of all Liturgies extant, in which is deſcribed the Order of the ſolemn Service of the Church, that is, when the Euchariſt was celebrated; firſt, that of all Leſſons of the Scriptures, thoſe out of the Goſpels were read in the laſt place, as it is expreſſed in S. Auguſtine alledged, before in the Conſtitutions of the Apoſtles, and in
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:169390:172"/> divers others, that might be produced were it queſtionable: Then, that after the reading of the Goſpel, followed the Sermon for the expoſition of it, or ſome other of the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. And yet in Dionyſius there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all of the Sermon, either in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription he makes of the Service, or in the Expoſition wherein he renders a reaſon of it, but immediately after the reading of the Goſpel, the laſt in order of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Hearers and Penitent and the like are diſmiſſed, and then follows the Creed. Which to me is an argument of the Authours time, and that when he writ, the Sermon in ſome places began to be diſuſed, and alſo, becauſe he mentions the Creed in the order of Publick Service, of which in Juſtine, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian, the Conſtitutions of the Apoſtles, the Canons of Laodicea, wherein almoſt all the particulars of Publick Service are order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in fine, whereof in the moſt Ancient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of the Service there is no remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. It appeared afore by the words of S. Ambroſe, and ſo it doth by Dionyſius, that it was pronounced from the beginning of the uſe of it, by the whole Congregation: for the firſt expounded the words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Every woman praying or propheſying,</hi> of ſaying or ſinging the Creed; and the ſecond ſaith thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>The Catholick</hi>

                  <hi>Hymne being acknowledged before, by all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the Church.</hi> This is then the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of that former part of Publick Service which from the beginning the Hearers and Penitents were to be preſent at, to learn the doctrine of the Church, and to profit in it, ſo as to be thought fit for Baptiſme and for the Communion of the Euchariſt. For the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Maſſe (aſwell as all other Liturgies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant) though reduced to ſo ſmall a model as was obſerved, by the ſhortneſſe of the Pſalmes and Leſſons, and leaving out the Sermon, alwayes principall ingredients of it, repreſenteth nevertheleſſe the Order and Courſe of that ſolemn Service which the Euchariſt was celebrated with. This diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the firſt and ſecond Service in the Liturgies extant, is rather retained for faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſake, and in remembrance of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Order, then according to the Originall purpoſe of it: for it ſhall appear that ſome part of the Prayers which at the firſt were for believers alone, and ſuch as communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, not to come till the Hearers and Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents were gone forth, in all the Greek and Eaſtern Liturgies are now put into the firſt part of the Service. But the end of the firſt Service, and the beginning of that which onely believers were preſent at, is manifeſt enough in it (as it is in down-right terms ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in all the Greek and Eaſtern Liturgies
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:169390:173"/> when the Hearers were to go forth) not in the place where Durandus would have it, iiii. 1. after the Offering; but as it is in the Conſtitutions of the Apoſtles, in the 18 Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of Laodicea, in Dionyſius, in others, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Prayers for the Hearers &amp; Penitents, which followed as ſoon as the Sermon was done, immediately before the Creed. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, from hence it appeareth, that the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Epiſtles and Goſpels are origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally belonging to the former part of this Service. The 18 Canon of Laodicea, of theſe Prayers for the Hearers and Penitents ſpeaketh thus, <gap reason="foreign">

Theſe forms are here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, both to declare the ancient practice, and alſo for a help toward the underſtanding of that which follows. After the departure of the Hearers and Penitents, there followed principally two ſorts of Prayers, as may be gathered from the words of Juſtine in his ſecond Apologie, where that moſt Ancient Martyr that flouriſhed ſome thirty or fourty years after S. Johns death, that is, after the Age of the Apoſtles, relates the courſe of publick Service at the Aſſemblies of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. After the Sermon, he thus deſcribes what followed, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>After, we all</hi>

                  <hi>riſe, and ſend forth prayers, and, as we ſaid afore, when we have done praying, bread and wine and water are offered: And the Ruler like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſendeth forth prayers and thanksgivings with all his might.</hi> Here you have the Prayers of the whole Congregation in the firſt place, which therefore are called in the words related in the beginning of this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Common Prayers,</hi> or Prayers of the whole Congregation, to diſtinguiſh them from thoſe Prayers &amp; Thanksgivings, which he ſaith were made afterwards, for conſecrating of the Euchariſt, by the Biſhop or Presbyter alone, though in behalf of the people. Where, by the way, you may ſee further that Juſtine means by thoſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to expreſſe nothing but that earneſt devotion which thoſe Prayers were offered with, by that which he addeth <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>likewiſe:</hi> For having ſaid in the words al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged afore that the Congregation made the former ſort, which he calleth their Common Prayers, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>vehemently,</hi> he addeth, that the Biſhop made the Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving which the Euchariſt was conſecrated with, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>in like ſort with all his might:</hi> with the like earneſt devotion which the other were made with. The moſt Ancient deſcription that we have next to this, of the Form of this ſolemn Service, ſeems to be that which is found in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:169390:175"/> of the Apoſtles. For by many things we may find, that that book meant to expreſſe the Cuſtomes of the Church, in the times afore Conſtantine. You may have obſerved before, how it forbiddeth the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to plead before the Powers of this world, that is, before heathen Magiſtrates. And that courſe of dividing Portions at their Feaſts of love, which is there preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, was afore obſerved to be aboliſhed by the Councel of Laodicea, which was before Conſtantine. And in the Form of Prayer for all ſtates of the Church after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration (whereof afterwards) ſet down there viii. 12. it is to be obſerved, that Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is made for the Emperour and Powers of the world, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>that they may keep peace with us,</hi> that is, not perſecute the Church. In this Work then, l. viii. c. 10. 11. is deſcribed at large, firſt, the Prayer for the whole ſtate of the Church, and the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular members and conditions of it, and after that, c. 12. the Prayer of Thanksgiving which the Euchariſt was conſecrated with: And to ſhew evident diſtinction of theſe two parts of the Service, the kiſſe of Peace comes between both, which being a received Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome from the time of the Apoſtles, gives cauſe to preſume, that the Prayers, between which it is interpoſed, are no leſſe derived from the Primitive practice of the Apoſtles
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:169390:176"/> time. Though true it is, that according to the Cuſtome of the Weſtern Churches, it followed after the Conſecration of the Euchariſt, before the receiving of it. There follows beſides in the ſame place, a new ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition of the Deacon to all that had not right to Communicate, to depart before the celebration of the Euchariſt, among the reſt <gap reason="foreign">

Wiſhing them long life, ſecure rule, the Court ſafe, the Armies valiant, the Senate faithfull, the people good, the world quiet, whatſoever a man and Ceſar may deſire:</hi> Tertullian, as Caſſander obſerved before, intended not to declare to the Heathen the manner of cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating the Euchariſt, as the cuſtome was to keep it private, leſt it might incurre the
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:169390:177"/> ſcorn of thoſe that underſtood not what it meant: Thoſe which Juſtine calls the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayers of the Congregation, which went next afore it, are here deſcribed by thoſe paſſages that deſerved moſt favour at the worlds hands. In the 18 Canon of Laodicea, after the departure of the Hearers and Penitents, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or <hi>by way of ſpeaking to the people,</hi> the matter is plain out of that which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared afore, concerning the Form of the prayers for the Hearers and Penitents, in which the Deacon ſpake to the people, from point to point directing them what to deſire of God on their behalf, the people anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to every point, <hi>Lord have mercy;</hi> which prayers were therefore called <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or <hi>Allocutions,</hi> in the Conſtitutions of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. In like ſort were theſe Prayers for

I ſpeak not now of the uſe of them in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, for diverting the wrath of God in publick calamities, and the like occaſions, or of what was put in practice therein by Claudianus Mamertus, Gregory the Great, and others: I ſpeak of the Originall and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall uſe of them, in that ſolemn Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Church, which the Euchariſt was celebrated with: For in all Liturgies extant, which, though they be not ſo ancient as the Titles of them pretend, nevertheleſſe retain the traces of ancient Forms in all parts, it is eaſily to be perceived, both by the form of thoſe prayers which are miniſtred by the
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:169390:178"/> Deacon, the people anſwering, and alſo by the ſubject of them, concerning all eſtates of the Church, and the proſperous condition of it, that they are nothing elſe but thoſe Common Prayers whereof Juſtine Martyr of ſo ancient time ſpeaketh, according to the forms practiſed at ſeverall times, and in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall places. True it is, that in thoſe ancient Liturgies they come not after the departure of the Hearers, as in Juſtine, and the Canon of Laodicea, and the Conſtitutions of the Apoſtles. But when the departure of the Hearers was retained in a manner for faſhions ſake, in remembrance of the ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, the reaſon of it being ceaſed, when the world was become Chriſtian, it is reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to think, that the Order of the Service depending upon it might change, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance nevertheleſſe remaining, as deſcending Originally from the Apoſtles. And though it be not eaſie for me to give account, why the Canon of Laodicea preſcribeth two of theſe prayers to be made, dividing it into two, or repeating it twice, yet it is eaſie for any man to obſerve, eſpecially in the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies intitled to S. Baſil and S. Chryſoſtome, that theſe Prayers are divers times repeated, whether in brief or at large; that faſhion ſo farre complying with the Preſcript of the Canon, as to ſhew us, that thoſe are the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers where of it ſpeaketh. The ſubject of them
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:169390:178"/> is thus compriſed in another place of the Conſtitutions, ii. 51. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or <hi>the generall Collect.</hi> From whence it appeareth, that this is the Prayer whereof Tertullian ſpeaketh, the ſubject where of he expreſſeth, <hi>pro ſtatu ſeculi, pro rerum quiete: for the ſettled and quiet ſtate of the world.</hi> That which hath been ſaid of the Manner and Order of this Prayer, is to be underſtood of the Liturgies of the Eaſtern Churches now extant. Not onely in thoſe Greekiſh ones under the names of S. James, S. Mark, S. Baſil, S. Chryſoſtome, but in the Ethiopick, in that of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of S. Thomas in India, in that of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronites printed at Rome, it taketh place ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the manner deſcribed. Of the Service of the Latine Church the like can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:169390:179"/> be ſaid. The Litanies, whereof this Prayer is the ſource, are uſed upon ſeverall particular Occaſions in the Maſſe, as it is now, but have no place in the Ordinary Courſe of it, unleſſe we ſuppoſe the <hi>Kyrie cleeſon</hi> which the Rationaliſts call the Lita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, to be that which remains of them, the model of the Latine Service being ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridged as was obſerved afore. And by S. Ambroſe, or whoſoever writ thoſe books <hi>de Sacramentis,</hi> it appeareth, that prayer was made to that effect before the conſecration of the Euchariſt, his words are iv. 4. <hi>Oratio praemittitur pro populo, pro Regibus, pro caeteris: Prayer is premiſed,</hi> ſaith he, (to the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of the Euchariſt) <hi>for the people, for the Emperours, for the reſt.</hi> But in thoſe words he ſpeaketh of prayers that were made at the Lords bord by him that celebrated the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, of which afterwards, not of thoſe that were miniſtred by the Deacon ſpeaking to the people in the manner aforeſaid: which nevertheleſſe S. Auguſtine of the Latine Church remembreth, when he ſaith, Epiſt. 118. <hi>Cùm communis oratio voce Diaconi indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur, when Common prayer is indicted by the Deacons voyce:</hi> for this is that which Juſtine Martyr called <hi>Common Prayer</hi> afore. Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanus in Tertull. de Corona, <hi>Et arbitrantur quidem illi Miſſam incepiſſe, dicente Saceraote, Dominus vobiſcum: &amp; mox, Surſum corda.</hi>
                  <pb n="347" facs="tcp:169390:179"/> 
                  <hi>Gratias agamus Domino Deo noſtro: And they truly</hi> (that is, thoſe that ſtudied the Ancient Form of Service, out of the eldeſt and beſt Church-writers) <hi>think that the Maſſe begins when the Prieſt ſayes,</hi> THE LORD BE VVITH YOU, <hi>and by and by,</hi> LIFT UP YOUR HEARTS; <hi>afterwards,</hi> LET us GIVE THANKS TO OUR LORD GOD. If his meaning be that the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of the Euchariſt began alwayes with the Preface, <hi>Surſum corda,</hi> well and good. But if he mean this, that the ſecond Service, or the Prayers at which Believers alone were preſent, began then, it is an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight: The teſtimonies produced are beyond exception to ſhow that according to the moſt ancient Cuſtome of the Church, prayer was made for all ſtates of men, and of the Church firſt, in the manner aforeſaid. In fine, the great agreement of all the Liturgies ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, coming from thoſe moſt Ancient Eaſtern Churches, with the eldeſt of Church-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, together with other pregnant circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that concurre, make me bold to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the practice of theſe prayers is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the Apoſtles, and the Cuſtome of their time, and are the ſame whereof S. Paul writes, Rom. viii. 26, 27. <hi>Likewiſe the ſpirit al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought: but the ſpirit it ſelf maketh interceſsion for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered. And he that ſearcheth</hi>

                  <hi>the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that it maketh interceſsion for the Saints ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to God.</hi> For according to the expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of S. Chryſoſtome, proved good afore, theſe prayers, which in the Primitive times were made by men indued with Prophetick Graces, called here <hi>the Spirit,</hi> were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards miniſtred by the Deacon, going afore the people: which holds good of theſe, not onely according to all the Liturgies and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities alledged, but according to Juſtine in chief, and in the eldeſt place, who, when he relates that he which miniſtred the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, began not but with the Thankſgiving, after theſe which he calls the Common Prayers were ended, gives preſumption e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that the ſaid Common Prayers were miniſtred by the Deacon with him, as with S. Chryſoſtome. Then the terms in which the Apoſtle expreſſes the nature of theſe prayers, calling them <hi>Interceſsions for the Saints,</hi> ſeem to ſpecifie the ſubject whereof we ſpeak, for all ſtates of the Church. And laſt, when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>maketh interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for us with gronings not to be uttered:</hi> and afore verſ. 23. <hi>Our ſelves alſo which have the firſt-fruits of the ſpirit, even we our ſelves grone within our ſelves:</hi> S.

And perhaps the Apoſtle, when he ſaid 1.

<pb n="350" facs="tcp:169390:181"/> but thoſe whereof he writes to the Romanes, thoſe firſt ſort of Prayers whereof here we ſpeak, at the Service of believers. For in that which follows verſ. 16. <hi>Elſe when thou ſhalt bleſſe with the ſpirit, how ſhall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned ſay Amen at thy giving of thanks, ſeeing he underſtandeth not what thou ſayeſt? for thou verily giveſt thanks well, but the other is not edified:</hi> many things induce me to think, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of nothing elſe, but of that Thankſgiving, which from the beginning the Euchariſt was conſecrated with, and from which it hath the name, and is the next point in the order of this Service. For ſo the Apoſtles directions will appear complete, reaching to all parts of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which proceed from mens particulars. For the reading of the Scriptures we muſt here except, preſuppoſed as the ſubject and imployment of preſent Graces. For the Pſalmes of Gods praiſes, which the ſpirit then indicted, he provideth when he ſaith, <hi>I will ſing with the ſpirit, but I will ſing with the underſtanding alſo.</hi> For the Expoſition of the Scriptures, more at large, in the rules that follow, from verſ. 26. For the Prayers which by the ſuggeſtion of the holy Ghoſt were made for the Church and all States of it, when he ſaith, <hi>I will pray with the ſpirit, but I will pray with the understanding alſo.</hi> For the Prayers which the Euchariſt was celebrated
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:169390:181"/> with, in the words now in hand, verſ. 16, 17. The Commentaries under S. Ambroſe his name: <hi>Hi ex Hebraeis erant, qui aliquando Syrâ linguâ, plerumque Hebraeâ in Tractatibus &amp; Oblationibus utebantur ad commendationem. Gloriabantur enim ſe dici Hebraeos, propter me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritum Abrahae: Theſe</hi> (that would needs ſpeak in ſtrange Languages in the Church) <hi>were of the Hebrews, which for their commendation, uſed ſometimes the Syriack, moſt an end the Hebrew, in their Sermons and Oblations.

The ſame is the argument of this Thanksgiving, in the Liturgies intitled to S. James, and S. Baſil, both the Greek and the Latine, and that which we have from Maſius out of the Syriack. In that of S. Chryſoſtome it is to the ſame purpoſe, but in fewer words; in that of S. Mark, the ſame for ſubſtance, but more in brief, and for Order ſomewhat o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe: So in that which I ſpake of, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the Arabick, under the names of S. Baſil, S. Gregory, and S. Cyril, in this laſt as in that of S. Mark, and not much otherwiſe in that of the Chriſtians of Saint Thomas in India. In the Canon of the Maſſe, that which is called the preface, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be that which remaineth of this Thanksgiving, for it expreſſeth the praiſes of God with much vehemence, though the ſubject of thoſe praiſes, either concerning the Creation of the world, or our redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption is not contained in it: For the Tenour of it is in a manner that of our Service, <hi>It is</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, according to Juſtine Martyr and Ireneus, did from the eldeſt times of the Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the remembrance of the Creation of all things, in regard to the ordinary uſe of Gods creatures, for the maintenance of our bodies, becauſe it was at the firſt practiſed, as it was inſtituted, at meat. So much the words of Juſtine Martyr related afore ſeem to import, when he affirmeth, that the onely Sacrifice that Chriſtians have received to offer, is that of Praiſe and Thanksgiving at their nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, at which remembrance is made of the Paſſion which God ſuffered for us. But as this Sacrament was frequented no otherwiſe then as the moſt ſolemn part of Gods publick Service at religious Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies for that purpoſe, whatſoever was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed more or leſſe of the ſubject of it, concerning the Creation and Redemption of the world, yet in all manner of Liturgies of all Chriſtian Churches, there is none, that I have ſeen, which doth not premiſe this
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:169390:184"/> Thanksgiving and praiſe to God, to the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of that Sacrament. And it is very remarkable, that in that diſtance of times and places, from which we receive the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall forms yet extant with ſo much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, as muſt needs proceed from thence, yet there are two particulars of it, in which all the Forms that are extant agree, the one the beginning of it, with <hi>Surſum corda,</hi> or <hi>Lift up your hearts,</hi> the people anſwering as we uſe it, and then to let us underſtand to what purpoſe they are exhorted to do it, <hi>Let us give thanks to our Lord God,</hi> ſpecifying the Prayer which I now deſcribe: The other is the Communion of the Church militant with the fellowſhip of Angels in this Office, expreſſed in the Trisagion or Seraphicall Hymne, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth,</hi> for though there is much difference between Forms that are extant, yet it will be hard to find any of them, wherein both thoſe have not a place, which, had the forms been arbitrary, could not have come to paſſe. Here a queſtion lies, to mine appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, very much concerning this purpoſe: whereas the Creatures of bread and wine are deputed to the effect of becoming the body and bloud of Chriſt to them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them aright, by the appointment of our Lord, executed by the Church, how it can be conceived, that by giving thanks to
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:169390:185"/> God, to the purpoſe ſpecified, they are, on the part of the Church, deputed to ſuch ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. To me it ſeemeth unqueſtionable, that the Thanksgiving, wherewith our Lord in the Goſpel is ſaid to have celebrated this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament at his laſt ſupper, contained alſo Prayer to God, for the effect to which the elements when they became this Sacrament, are deputed: And that the Church, upon his example, hath alwayes frequented his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution with the like, rehearſing his inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of the Goſpel, and praying for the effect of it at the preſent, after the Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving hitherto deſcribed: And ſo, whereas in the ſenſe of the Church of Rome, the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are conſecrated, that is, tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated into the body and bloud of Chriſt, by rehearſing the affirmative words of Chriſt, This is my body, this is my bloud, as opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: In the true ſenſe of the Church, they are conſecrated, that is, deputed to be this Sacrament, and to the effect of it, by the Prayer of the Congregation, grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the inſtitution of Chriſt, and the promiſe which it implyeth. Let me ſuppoſe in the firſt place, that the elements, by being depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to become this Sacrament, are not aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for their ſubſtance, nor ceaſe to be what they were, but yet begin to be what they were not, that is, viſible ſignes, not onely to figure the Sacrifice of Chriſt his
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:169390:185"/> Croſſe, which being ſo uſed, they are apt to do of themſelves, ſetting the inſtitution of Chriſt aſide, but alſo to tender and exhibite the inviſible Grace which they repreſent to them that receive. For, though no man can receive the body and bloud of Chriſt, that is not diſpoſed with a living Faith to receive the ſame, yet on Gods part it is undoubtedly tendred to thoſe that are not ſo diſpoſed, otherwiſe how ſaith the Apoſtle, that thoſe that eat and drink unworthily are guiltie of the body and bloud of Chriſt, as not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſame? And otherwiſe how ſaith our Lord of the elements, at the inſtant of delivering them, <hi>this is my body, this is my bloud,</hi> in the preſent tenſe? Let me ſuppoſe in the ſecond place, that our Lord, in cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating this Sacrament, made uſe of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived cuſtome of his people: which was, as ſtill it is, in receiving all good things at Gods hands, to premiſe Thanksgiving, or Bleſſing, as they call it, before they uſed them. In particular, at Feaſts, before ſupper was done, they took bread and broke it, and gave it about, and the cup of wine likewiſe, having bleſſed God for the uſe of thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent creatures. Upon ſolemnities, and particular occaſions, mention was made of that which the time required. This is the ground of thoſe two points of the Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving diſcuſſed afore, the uſe of thoſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:169390:186"/> and the redemption of the world which our Lord ſpecified, upon the exigenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the generall cuſtome, and the particula<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> occaſion, and the Primitive Chriſtians, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Juſtine Martyr, frequented upon his example. But, as in the like caſe, at the miracle of the Loaves, when it is ſaid, <hi>that our Lord looked up to heaven and bleſſed,</hi> Matt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> xiv. 19. <hi>or gave thanks,</hi> as it is, John vi. 11. i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> cannot be doubted that beſides bleſſing God for his creatures, he prayed alſo for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of that which he intended to do: No more is it to be doubted that the Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving which he made over thoſe elements for that which they repreſented contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo Prayer, that by them it might be communicated to his diſciples. The tenour and conſequence of our Lords words requires no leſſe. For that which is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed muſt be true before it be truly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and the proceſſe of this action, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and delivering the elements, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding to receive them as his body and bloud, importeth that he intended to affirm that ſo they were, in the true ſenſe which the words import, at the inſtant of delivering them. And by what conſequence could his diſciples conceive them to be deputed, for ſignes to exhibite his body and bloud, upon his giving of Thanks over them for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the world, unleſſe we ſuppoſe
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:169390:186"/> his Thanksgiving, whereof the Goſpel ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, to contain alſo Prayer, that they might become effectuall to that purpoſe? And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with agreeth that of the Apoſtle; <hi>Every creature of God is good, and none to be rejected, being received with Thanksgiving: for it is ſanctified by the word of God, and prayer.</hi> For here, the Thanksgiving, wherewith the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are ſanctified to the nouriſhment of our bodies, containeth alſo prayer, grounded upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Word of God, whereby he appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them for that purpoſe: Accordingly therfore, the Thanksgiving, wherewith theſe elements were ſanctified by our Lord to be the nouriſhment of the ſoul, muſt contain prayer, not grounded upon the inſtitution of God to that purpoſe, (becauſe the act of Chriſt for the preſent, went before his inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution for the future) but as joyned to his command, grounding a word of promiſe to the Church, whereupon it was to do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. And herewith agree thoſe Forms of Thanksgiving, or, as they call them Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which the Jews at this day practice, from very ancient time, as they pretend: For the foot and cloſe of divers the moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of them, is with prayer for the bleſsing of God upon that wherefore they give Thanks. For example, among the daily xviii. <hi>Bleſſed be thou, O Lord our God, that removeſt ſleep from our eyes, and ſlumbring from our eye-lids:</hi>
                  <pb n="362" facs="tcp:169390:187"/> 
                  <hi>And let it pleaſe thee, O Lord our God, and God of our Fathers, to practiſe us in thy Law, and to make us cleave to thy precepts, and bring us not into ſinne, and tranſgreſsion, and temptation, and contempt,</hi> and ſo forth, ending thus, <hi>Bleſſed be thou, O Lord, that giveſt good graces.</hi> The bleſſing of the Law, that is, the Thanksgiving to God for it, is this, <hi>Bleſſed art thou, O Lord our God, the King of the world, that hath ſanctified us with his precepts, &amp; given us command concerning the matters of the Law: And ſweeten, O God, the words of the Law in our mouth, and in the mouth of thy people the houſe of Iſrael: And make us all, and our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and our childrens children, knowers of thy Name, and learners of thy Law for it ſelf: Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed art thou, O Lord, that teacheſt thy people Iſrael the Law.</hi> So in the Bleſſing of wine, ſo in the Bleſſing after meat. And ſo for the reſemblance of the Bleſsing of our Lord o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the elements with theſe, and the exigence of the buſineſſe, may we juſtly preſume that it ran in the like form, to the purpoſe of it. And laſt of all, herewith agreeth the practice of the ancient Church, wherein for certain, the Thanksgiving deſcribed afore was joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with prayer for the effect of that which was done. So ſaith Juſtine, that the Preſident ſent forth PRAYERS AND THANKSGIVINGS to God. So in Tertullian <hi>de or at.</hi> C. xiiii. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſiciorum orationes,</hi> and in the next words,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:169390:187"/> 
                  <hi>Euchariſtia</hi> ſtand both for the ſame. So in the ciiii of the Africane Canons theſe Thanksgivings are called <hi>Prefaces,</hi> to my thinking, becauſe this Thanksgiving was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes premiſed to the prayer which the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt was conſecrated with. I will here propound that Form of Prayer which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth after the rehearſall of the inſtitution of this Sacrament, in the place alledged of the Conſtitutions of the Apoſtles. For a Prayer to the like effect is to be found in all the Eaſtern Liturgies. Which if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with the Teſtimonies of Eccleſiaſticall Writers, which divers have produced to prove, that the elements are not conſecrated by the affirmative words of Chriſt, as ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, but by the prayers of the Church, it will appear, that it is the prayer whereof we now ſpeak, alwayes uſed in the Church, to obtain of God the promiſe which the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt ſuppoſeth, that the elements preſent might be deputed to the effect of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming viſible ſignes, tendring &amp; exhibiting the inviſible grace which they figure. Which is that which in this matter is called Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, as I ſuppoſe. Having repeated the inſtitution of this Sacrament out of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels, where we left afore, it followeth, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>—Therefore mindfull of his Paſsion, and death, and riſing from the dead, and aſcenſion into heaven, and of his ſecond ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,</hi>
                  <pb n="364" facs="tcp:169390:188"/> 
                  <hi>at which he is to come with glory and power to judge the quick and dead, and to render to every man according to his works, we offer to thee our King and God, according to his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, this bread and this cup, giving thanks to thee through him, that thou haſt vouchſafed us to ſtand before thee, and to miniſter unto thee: And beſeech thee that thou wouldeſt look favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably upon theſe Oblations preſent before thee, thou God that wanteſt nothing, and accept them to the honour of thy Chriſt, and ſend down the holy Spirit, witneſſe of the paſsions of the Lord Jeſus, upon this Sacrifice, to exhibite this bread the body, and this cup the bloud of thy Chriſt: That they which pertake of it, may be confirmed in godlineſſe, obtain remiſsion of ſinnes, be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the devil and his deceit, be filled with the holy Ghoſt, become worthy of thy Chriſt, and obtain life everlasting, thou being reconciled to them, God Almighty.</hi> It is clearly true in the ſenſe and language of the ancient Church, which S. Ambroſe ſaith, <hi>De iis qui myst. init. C. ix. Ante conſecrationem alia ſpecies nominatur, poſt conſecrationem, corpus Chriſti ſignificatur: Before Conſecration another ſpecies is named</hi> (that is the bread) <hi>after it the body of Chriſt is ſignified.</hi> And <hi>de Sacr.</hi> v. 4. <hi>Dixi vobis, quòd ante verba Chriſti, quod offertur, panis dicatur, ubi Christi verba depromta fuerint, jam non pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis dicitur, ſed corpus appellatur: I told you that before the words of Chriſt, that which is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered</hi>

                  <hi>is called bread; after the words of Chriſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e produced, it is no more called bread, it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his body.</hi> Therefore, whereas in this pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the elements are named by their kind, of bread and wine, it is plain, that all that while they are not conceived or intended to be conſecrated. And what doubt can there be in that, when we ſee a prayer follow, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is deſired, that the elements may become the body and bloud of Chriſt? And he that ſhall turn over the Copies of Liturgies, which we have extant from the Eaſtern Churches, ſhall find them to agree in this: That after the inſtitution is rehearſed out of the Goſpels, profeſſing that what is preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done, is in obedience to the ſame, prayer is made firſt, that by the holy Ghoſt the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be ſanctified to become the body and bloud of Chriſt, and then, that they may be to ſuch effects of grace, as are ſpecified in the form rehearſed to them that communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. Onely in the Miſſall of the Maronites, printed at Rome, there be divers forms of Conſecration (which they call <hi>Anaphora)</hi> under the Apoſtles names, and other Eaſtern Doctours, wherein this prayer ſeemeth to be wilfully changed, to make them conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the doctrine of the now Church of Rome. It was printed there for the uſe of that nation, in the yeare MDXCIV. In the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent form of the Latine Church, there ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:169390:189"/> (not by the now Canon of the Maſſe but by the remembrance of it extant in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church-writers) to have been ſome difference from this, and that difference ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to have occaſioned the errour of the now Church of Rome, concerning Conſecration by operative words. Nevertheleſſe the words of S. Ambroſe, or whoſoever writ thoſe books <hi>de Sacram.</hi> are theſe, v. 4. <hi>Vis ſcire quia verbis coelestibus conſecratur? accipe quae ſint verba. Dicit Sacerdos, Fac nobis hanc hoſtiam aſſcriptam, rationabilem, acceptabilem, quod eſt figura corporis &amp; ſanguinis Domini no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stri Jeſu Christi. Qui pridie quàm pateretur—Wilt thou know that it is conſecrated by the heavenly words? heare what be the words: The Prieſt ſaith, Make this Sacrifice imputable, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable, acceptable for us, which is the figure of the body and bloud of our Lord Jeſus Christ. Who the night before he ſuffered—</hi>&amp; ſo forth, proceeding to rehearſe the inſtitution out of the Goſpel. In the Canon of the Maſſe is added, <hi>ratam,</hi> or ratified; <hi>Fac nobis hanc ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiam aſſcriptam, ratam, rationabilem,</hi> much to my purpoſe. For it is plain that this is not the doctrine of the now Church of Rome, when, being to ſhew how the elements are conſecrated, he produceth the prayer of the Church joyned to the inſtitution of Chriſt: Which is to ſay, that by virtue of Chriſts inſtitution, executed by the Church, with
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:169390:189"/> prayer to God to ratifie and accept the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments preſently offered, to be the figure and remembrance of the body and bloud of Chriſt, they are deputed to become this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. In the Canon of the Maſſe theſe words are ſomewhat changed from that which is ſet down in S. Ambroſe, for they are read thus, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t nobis corpus &amp; ſanguis ſiant dilectiſsimi Filii tui Domini noſtri Jeſu Chriſti: That they may become to us the body and bloud of thy moſt beloved Sonne our Lord Christ Jeſus.</hi> And it ſeemeth that they were changed on purpoſe, that this Sacrament might not be called a Figure of the inviſible Grace of it. But in the mean time it is manifeſt, that here prayer is made for the effect of Chriſts inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution in theſe elements, and that nothing can be more croſſe to this doctrine of the now Church of Rome, then their own Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. S. Ambroſe obſerved, that after the inſtitution is rehearſed, the elements are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the body and bloud: The reaſon ſeems to be, becauſe they were intended to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to become this Sacrament, by prayer grounded on the inſtitution of Chriſt, which it is joyned with. But it ſhould ſeem, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the inſtitution there followed in the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent form of the Latine Church, a prayer to the purpoſe, though not in the terms of that which now followeth in the Canon of the Maſſe, the cloſe whereof is this, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t quot quot</hi>
                  <pb n="368" facs="tcp:169390:190"/> 
                  <hi>ex hac altaris participatione Sacroſanctum Filii tui corpus &amp; ſanguinem ſumſerimus, omni be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictione coeleſti &amp; gratiâ repleamur: That as many as ſhall receive the holy body and bloud of thy Sonne, by participating of this altar, may be fulfilled with thy heavenly benediction &amp; grace.</hi> Which is plainly in lieu of the ſecond point of that prayer alledged out of all the Eaſtern Liturgies, deſiring the like effects of grace, by the means of this Sacrament upon them that communicate. If any man think that the Forms hitherto deſcribed import, that the ancient Church intended to conſecrate the elements, in the ſenſe of the now Church of Rome, that is, to aboliſh the corporall ſubſtance of them, and ſubſtitute that of the body and bloud of Chriſt in ſtead, not in the true ſenſe, to depute them to become viſible ſignes, tendring and exhibiting the inviſible Grace which they figure, he ſhall much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the truth which we profeſſe: The due advantage whereof hath been long ſince pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be this, that the errour pinned upon it, is not to be found ſo much as in the Service of the Church where it is bred &amp; maintained. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Prayer is made co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the elements in the Canon of the Maſſe, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t nobis corpus fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant dilectiſsimi Filii tui Domini nostri Jeſu Chriſti: That they may become to us the body and bloud of thy welbeloved Sonne our Lord Christ Jeſus:</hi> Theſe words <hi>to us,</hi> make an abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:169390:190"/> in the proper ſignification of the body and bloud. For the elements may be ſaid to become the body and bloud of Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out addition, in the ſame true ſenſe in which they are ſo called in the Scriptures. But when they are ſaid to become the body and bloud of Chriſt to them that communicate, that true ſenſe is ſo well ſignified and expreſſed, that the words cannot well be underſtood otherwiſe, then to import not the corporall ſubſtance, but the ſpirituall uſe of them. In the Greekiſh form, prayer is made, that the elements may be made, or become, or be changed, or tranſlated into the body and bloud of Chriſt. That alſo among our Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Controverſies is acknowledged to be verified, and is indeed eaſily verified, though we ſuppoſe them not to ceaſe to be what they were, but to become what they were not, that is, viſible ſignes exhibiting the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible grace which they figure. To which meaning, that which alwayes follows in that form directs us, when prayer is made, that the elements may become the body and bloud of Chriſt, ſo that they which receive them may be fulfilled with the bleſſings of his grace: Which is to ſay, that they may become that which they are called, (to wit, the body and bloud of Chriſt) not in reſpect of the corporall ſubſtance and kind, whereof they conſiſt, but in reſpect to the ſpirituall
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:169390:191"/> communion which they exhibit. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, when S. Ambroſe ſaith that after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration the body of the Lord and his bloud onely is named, and ſignified, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, this alſo ſeems to import a great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement of the proper ſignification of the body and bloud of Chriſt: As being ſo called and named and ſignified to us, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſubſtance of their nature and kind is aboliſhed, but becauſe it comes no more into conſideration, as not concerning the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all benefit of them that communicate. Which ſeemeth to be the true reaſon, why Church-writers continually call the elements by the names of that which they exhibit, without ſuch addition as might import that abatement whereof now we ſpeak: who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe otherwhiles ſtick not to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that the ſpecies of the elements (that is, in their ſenſe, not the outward appearance of the accidents, as thoſe of the Church of Rome diſguiſe the true meaning of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine word, but the inward nature and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of their kind) doth remain as it was. It remaineth now to declare both the right purpoſe and true meaning of that prayer for all States of the Church, which in all Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, that I have ſeen, is made at conſecrating the Euchariſt, and before the receiving of it. In that which hath been hitherto repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, out of the Conſtitutions of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:169390:191"/> as in the moſt of the Eaſtern Liturgies, immediately after the Conſecration hitherto deſcribed. The beginning of it there is thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: <hi>Further we pray thee, O Lord, for thy holy Church from end to end, which thou haſt purchaſed with the precious bloud of thy Chriſt, that thou wouldst keep it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, unwaved, till the end of the world. And for all Biſhops that divide the word of truth aright. Further we pray thee for the meanneſſe of me that offer to thee. For the whole Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for the Deacons and all the Clergy, that—Further, for the King and Powers, that they may keep peace toward us. Further, we offer to thee for all the Saints that have pleaſed thee from the beginning of the world—Further, we pray thee for all this people, reckoning virgins, widows, married, and infants. Further we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat for this city, for the ſick, the baniſhed, ſlaves, travellers, and thoſe that are at home, that—Further, we pray thee for thoſe that hate us and perſecute us for thy name, for thoſe that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and go aſtray, that—Further, for the Hearers, the Poſſeſſed, the Penitents, that—Further, we offer to thee for ſeaſonable weather, and increaſe of fruits, that—Further, we pray thee for the abſent for reaſonable cauſes, that—</hi>In the ſame place, that is, immediately after
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:169390:192"/> the Conſecration of the Euchariſt, is this Prayer made, in the Liturgies attributed to S. James, S. Baſil, and S. Chryſoſtome. In the ſame place, in all the forms related under the names of ancient Saints and Doctours of the Church, in the Miſſall of the Maronites, unleſſe it be one. But in the Liturgie intitled to S. Mark, this prayer is inſerted ſtraight after the beginning of the Euchariſt or Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving deſcribed afore. In the Ethiopick, immediately after the ſalutation of Peace, which in the Eaſtern Churches was alwayes ſtraight before the Euchariſt. In that of S. Cyril among the three tranſlated out of the Arabick and mentioned afore, in the ſame place with that of S. Mark. From whence we may argue this to have been the courſe of the Church of Alexandria, by the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment obſerved, between thoſe Liturgies that are intitled to thoſe that were Biſhops of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria, and the Ethiopick depending upon that Church, wherein they differ from the reſt. Yet ſo it is alſo in that of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of S. Thomas in the Eaſt Indies. In the Latine Churches this prayer ſeemeth of old to have gone before the Conſecration, for S. Ambroſe deſcribing the Conſecration, ſaith, <hi>de Sacram.</hi> iv. 4. <hi>Oratio praemittitur pro populo, pro regibus, pro caeteris: Prayer is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed for the people, for the king, for the reſt.</hi> And S. Auguſtine, <hi>Epiſt. lix. Eligo in his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis</hi>
                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:169390:192"/> 
                  <hi>hoc intelligere, quod omnis vel penè omnis frequentat Eccleſia, ut Precationes accipiamus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctas, quas facimus in Celebratione Sacramento<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, antequam illud quod eſt in Domini menſa incipiat benedici; Orationes, cum benedicitur &amp; ſanctificatur: I chooſe to underſtand in theſe words</hi> (of S. Paul to Timothy 1. ii. 1, 2.) <hi>that which all or almoſt all the Church frequenteth, that we take thoſe to be called Supplications, which we make at celebrating the Sacraments, before that which is on the Lords Board begin to be bleſſed; Prayers, when it is bleſſed and ſanctified.</hi> For without peradventure, theſe are the ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations for all ſtates of the Church, whereof he ſpeaketh. The Order of this Prayer in the Canon of the Maſſe is ſomewhat ſtrange: for he that will take notice of that which goes before the words of Inſtitution, and that which follows after the ſame, untill the Lords Prayer, comparing all with the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of other Liturgies, may obſerve, that they are all parcels of this Prayer for all States of Chriſts Church, which here we deſcribe. And I obſerve, that in that form which is intitled to S. Peter, in the Miſſall of the Maronites, this prayer is likewiſe made, both before the words of Inſtitution, and after the ſame. I am punctuall in obſerving the tenour of ſeveral Liturgies in this point, to give notice, that there is no ancient or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ancient form extant, wherein prayer
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:169390:193"/> is not made by him that celebrateth the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt at the Lords Board, to this purpoſe. A thing which ſeemeth to me ſomewhat ſtrange, that, according to the generall Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the Church declared afore, prayer having been made by the people a little afore upon the ſame ſubject, that is, for all States of Chriſts Church, though not in the ſame manner, but bidden by the Deacon, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by the people, the ſame prayers ſhould be again repeated by him that cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brateth the Euchariſt, at the Lords Board. Which is more, the Church of Africk ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to have differed from the reſt in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of this prayer, whereof we ſpeak, by S. Auguſtines words, <hi>Epiſt. cvi. Quando audis Sacerdotem ad Altare exhortantem populum Dei, or a pro incredulis, ut eos Deus convertat ad fidem, &amp; pro Catechumenis, ut eis deſiderium regenerationis inſpiret, &amp; pro fidelibus ut in eo quod eſſe coeperunt, ejus munere perſeverent: When thou heareſt the Priest at the Altar exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people of God, pray for the unbelievers, that God would convert them to the faith: and for the Hearers that he would inſpire the deſire of Regeneration into them. and for the faithfull, that by his Grace they may perſevere in that which they have begun to be.</hi> Compare we herewith his words that are read <hi>Epiſt. Cxviii. cap.</hi> 18 <hi>Quando autem non est tempus cùm in Eccleſia fratres congregantur ſancta can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandi,</hi>

When is it not time to ſing holy ſongs at the Aſſemblies of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in the Church, but in time of reading or preaching, or when the Biſhop prayes with a loud voice, or when Common Prayer is indicted by the Deacons voyce?</hi> Again, <hi>Epiſt.

When you heare the Prieſt of God at his Altar exhorting the people of God, or himſelf praying with a loud voice, that he would compell unbelieving Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to his Faith, do ye not anſwer, Amen?</hi> When S. Auguſtine mentioneth Common Prayer indicted by the Deacons voice, he acknowledgeth the Litanies deſcribed afore, (which Juſtine Martyr alſo calls Common Prayers, becauſe they proceeded from all the people) to have been practiſed in the Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane Churches, before the Euchariſt: which notwithſtanding, by his words it appeareth, that he which celebrated the Euchariſt, in the ſame form, was wont to exhort the people to make this prayer for all ſtates of perſons, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, Hearers, Believers (for inſtance of the reſt) which is not according to the form of any of thoſe Liturgies which we have, to my remembrance. But he informeth us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:169390:194"/> that thoſe things which the Biſhop ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted the people to pray for, the ſame he prayed for alone afterwards, and that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he means, when he ſpeaks of the Biſhop praying with a loud voice. It is hard for me to give account of this generall practice of the ancient Church, otherwiſe then by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture. Thus much may be affirmed with confidence, that the practice of this Prayer was the effect of the Apoſtles inſtruction, whereof our Service ſpeaketh; <hi>Who by thy holy Apoſtle haſt taught us to make prayers and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications and to give thanks for all men.</hi> The words of the Apoſtle, 1. Tim. ii. 1, 2. <hi>I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort therefore that firſt of all ſupplications, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, interceſsions, &amp; giving of thanks be made for all men, for Kings and all that are in Authority, that we may lead a quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able life in all godlineſſe and honeſty.</hi> S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe upon theſe words, <hi>Haec regula Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtica tradita eſt à Magiſtro Gentium,—This Eccleſiaſticall Rule is delivered to the Church by the Doctour of the Gentiles, which our Prieſts uſe, to make ſupplication for all, praying for the Kings of this world, that they may hold the Nations ſubject, that ſettled in peace, we may be able to ſerve our God with tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitie and quiet of mind. Praying alſo for thoſe that are truſted with high power, that they may govern the Common-wealth in juſtice and truth, with abundance of all things, that the</hi>
                  <pb n="377" facs="tcp:169390:194"/> 
                  <hi>trouble of ſedition being removed, gladneſſe may ſucceed.</hi> When he calleth it, The rule of that Service which their Prieſts miniſtred, it is plain he underſtandeth the words of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle concerning the Prayers which were made at the Lords Board, at celebrating the Euchariſt: Beſides the brief, which he rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, containeth the chief particulars of that form produced out of the Conſtitutions of the Apoſtles. So S. Auguſtine <hi>Ep. lix.</hi> in the words partly related afore, partly to be related afterwards, acknowledgeth the whole Order of the Service which the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt was celebrated with, to be preſcribed in theſe words of the Apoſtle. But this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to prove, there needs no great diſpute. The generall Cuſtome of the Ancient Church, gathered from the marvelous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement of all ancient forms of Service that remain, ſpeaks aloud, That this Prayer for all men at the Euchariſt, whereof we ſpeak, comes from the Order of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. It ſeemeth therefore to me moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the meaning of the Apoſtle is this, and ſo was underſtood and practiſed by all the ancient Church, that, at the celebration of the Euchariſt, Supplications and Prayers be made for all men, for Kings, &amp;c. For it is nothing forced or ſtrained to take the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>Thanksgivings,</hi> in the ſame ſenſe, in which it ſtands in the paſſages of
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:169390:195"/> Clemens and Ignatius alledged afore, for the Celebration of the Euchariſt, for the whole action, and all the Prayers which it was ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated with. And otherwiſe, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the Apoſtles words will be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether impertinent. For in the common and generall ſenſe of this word Thanksgiving, it is not proper to exhort that giving of thanks be made for all men, for Kings and ſo forth, that we may lead a peaceable life in all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and honeſtie: But it is proper to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort that Supplications and Prayers be made for all men, for Kings and the reſt, that by the means of their rule and government we may lead a peaceable life in all godlineſſe and honeſtie: And it is proper enough to exhort, that Thanksgivings be made for all men, to that purpoſe, underſtanding by Thanksgivings, that action of celebrating the Euchariſt, part whereof are thoſe Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications and Prayers. And thus, as in lieu of ſpirituall graces in Prayer, which were uſed to make Supplication for the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of all members and ſtates of the Church under the Apoſtle, according to S. Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome alledged afore, Prayers afterwards in moſt parts of the Church were indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the Deacon, and made by the people, which for the manner and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance both, were conceived afore, to be the Originall of thoſe that ſince have been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:169390:195"/> Litanies: So, nevertheleſſe, to give effect to this rule of the Apoſtle, it ſeemeth to have been an ancient and generall cuſtome of the Church, to make Supplications and Prayers at the Lords Board, at celebrating the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, though much to the ſame purpoſe with the former, for all ſtates of men, but of the Church in particular. And this nice obſervation, if it may take place, will be of great conſequence, to out the Church of Rome, of all pretenſe of the Sacrifice of the Maſſe in the ſenſe of the ancient Church, and in particular in the ſtyle and tenour of the Liturgies themſelves, which for the great agreement between themſelves, &amp; with the ſtyle of the moſt ancient Church-writers, ſeem to contain and expreſſe it. For it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that it is called an Oblation or Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, in all Liturgies, according to the ſtyle of the moſt ancient Church-writers, not as conſecrated, but as preſented and offered (whether by the people, as the cuſtome was, to him that miniſtred, or by him that mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to God) to be conſecrated, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. It is the ſtyle of the form produced out of the Conſtitutions of the Apoſtles, We offer unto thee this bread and this cup, beſeeching thee that they may become the body and bloud of Chriſt to the ſouls health of them that receive, or to that purpoſe. Thus farre there is no pretence of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:169390:196"/> of the Maſſe, which ſuppoſeth the body and bloud of Chriſt preſent, as the ſubject of it. True it is, that the ſtyle of this Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whereof we ſpeak, in divers points of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Liturgies runs in the terms of, <hi>we offer unto thee,</hi> for ſuch and ſuch, for this and that: But it is to be obſerved, that this Prayer came not after the Conſecration in all Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies, and according to the cuſtome of all Churches, to give occaſion to think, that the meaning is, to offer Chriſt there preſent by conſecration, for the ſaid perſons and cauſes, but went afore it in divers, as hath been ſaid, the purpoſe of it being to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Apoſtles exhortation, to make pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſupplications and interceſſions for all men at celebrating the Euchariſt. Beſides, it is no where ſaid, <hi>we offer unto thee the body and bloud of Christ</hi> for ſuch perſons and cauſes, but it is divers times ſaid, <hi>we offer unto thee</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>this reaſonable ſervice:</hi> and what is that but theſe Prayers? For in the form alledged, it is ſaid at ſome points, <hi>we pray thee for the Church, and for the King,</hi> at others, <hi>we offer unto thee for this people, and for the weather, and fruitfull ſeaſons,</hi> and ſhall we not think them both to ſtand in one ſenſe? It hath been ſhewed, that this Prayer is the practice of the Apoſtles exhortation, to make Prayers and Supplications &amp; Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings for all men: And it hath been decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:169390:196"/> that the meaning of his exhortation is, that at the celebration of the Euchariſt ſuch Prayers and Supplications be made. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when it is ſaid, by name, in the form related out of the Conſtitutions of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, <hi>we offer unto thee for this people, we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer unto thee for the weather and fruitfull ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> what ſhould hinder the meaning to be according, at this celebration of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, in confidence that thou heareſt thy Sonne for us, at this remembrance of his death, and in obedience to thine Apoſtle, we pray unto thee for ſuch perſons and cauſes? as it is in expreſſe terms in the Liturgie of the Indian Chriſtians, <hi>Hâc enim horâ quâ Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tri tuo Sacrificium offertur, rogo majeſtatem tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, miſerere omnium creaturarum. For at this houre, when Sacrifice is offered to thy Father, I pray thy Majeſtie, have mercie on all creatures.</hi> And thus, ſo often as we reade in Church-writers of offering for ſuch and ſuch perſons and cauſes, the meaning is, that they offered the elements, in which the Euchariſt was to be celebrated, that with it they might pray for thoſe perſons or cauſes, according to the Apoſtle. And if the queſtion be further made concerning offering for the dead, it ſhall ſeem to me nothing improbable, that becauſe the Apoſtle exhorteth that Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and Prayers and Interceſſions and Thanksgivings be made for all men, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:169390:197"/> the ancient Church inlarged the ſenſe of that ALL MEN further then they needed to do, to compriſe the dead as well as the living: and that thence came the comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of the dead at the Euchariſt, and the offering of the elements, that it might be celebrated, and that ſuch commemorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might be made. Though as concerning the particulars of the Prayers for the dead in the ancient Church, how farre they came from the Scripture, and how farre from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane opinions, in that whole matter I referre my ſelf to thoſe things which have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared with ſo much learning, by that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent learned Prelate, in his Anſwer to the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites challenge in Ireland. As for the reſt of the Service which the Euchariſt is celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with, after the Prayer hitherto deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, there follows in the Conſtitutions of the Apoſtles, a brief repetition of the Lita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, with a Prayer of the Biſhop, that the Congregation may worthily Communicate. In the time of Communicating, it is order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there, that the xxxiiii. Pſalme be ſung, in regard of the words, <hi>O taſt and ſee how gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious the Lord is!</hi> in other of the Eaſtern Liturgies, the xxiii. xlii. cxviii. cxliv. are preſcribed. The Latine Liturgiſts call the verſes of Pſalmes that are ſung during the time of Communicating, Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; and the Prayer or Thanksgiving
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:169390:197"/> that follows after the ſame, Poſtcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions. Such a form of Thanksgiving there is extant in all Liturgies. The people is diſmiſſed with the Benediction of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop in the Conſtitutions, which Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on comes after the Conſecration; before the Communion, in the moſt of other Liturgies. I will here repeat that whole paſſage of S. Auguſtine, the beginning whereof was produced afore, for it containeth the whole Order of theſe remains whereof we ſpeak. Ep. lix. <hi>Eligo in his verbis hoc intelligere, quod omnis vel penè omnis frequentat Eccleſia, ut Precationes accipiamus dictas, quas facimus in celebratione Sacramentorum, antequam illud quod eſt in Domini Menſa incipiat benedici; O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationes, cùm benedicitur, &amp; ſanctificatur, &amp; ad diſtribuendum comminuitur, quam totam pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titionem, ferè omnis Eccleſia Dominicâ oratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne concludit: Interpellationes autem, ſive ut vestri codices habent, Poſtulationes fiunt, cùm po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulus benedicitur: Tunc enim Antiſtites, velut Advocati, ſuſceptos ſuos per manuum impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem miſericordiſsimae offerunt poteſtati. Quo facto, &amp; participato tanto Sacramento, Gratia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum actio cuncta concludit. I chooſe to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand in theſe words, that which all or almoſt all the Church frequenteth, that we conceive thoſe to be called Supplications, which we make at ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrating the Myſteries, before that which is on the Lords Board begin to be bleſſed; Prayers,</hi>
                  <pb n="384" facs="tcp:169390:198"/> 
                  <hi>when it is bleſſed, and ſanctified, and broken to be diſtributed, which Petition almoſt all the Church concludes with the Lords Prayer:</hi> (ſo it is in all forms that are extant, and it is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mark that they were preſcript) <hi>But Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsions, or as your books have it, Requests are made, when the people is bleſſed: for then the Biſhops, as Advocates, receiving their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, offer them to the moſt mercifull power with impoſition of hands. Which done, and ſo great a Sacrament participated, all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes with Thankſgiving.</hi> The Ciii. of the Africane Canons related afore: <hi>Placuit etiam illud, ut preces quae probatae fuerint in Concilio, ſive Praefationes, ſive Commendationes, ſeu ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuum Impoſitiones ab omnibus celebrentur.</hi> It ſeems that the benedictions of the Biſhop or Presbyter that celebrated, (to whom this Office alſo belonged as S. Hierome contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) whereof we ſpeak, are called here Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, or Impoſitions of hands, to ſay, prayers to commend the people to God with impoſition of hands: unleſſe by theſe Commendations we underſtand thoſe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for all men, according to the Apoſtle, wherewith the ſeverall eſtates of all men, eſpecially of the Church, were commended to God: which ſaith S. Auguſtine went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſanctifying of the elements. In the Anaphora of S. Baſil publiſhed by Maſius out of the Syriack, there is this prayer at the
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:169390:198"/> beginning, before the Conſecration of the Euchariſt: <hi>Extende Domine manum tuam non aſſpectabilem, &amp; benedic ſervis &amp; ancillis tuis, mundatóque ipſos ab omni macula carnis &amp; ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritûs, at que dignare ipſosfieri participes corporis unigeniti Filii tui.</hi> The people bowed the head at receiving this bleſſing, the Biſhop holding his hands over them, as a ſigne of Gods hand ſtretched out to bleſſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaith, <hi>Extend, O Lord, thy inviſible hand, and bleſſe thy ſervants and handmaids, and cleanſe them from all ſtain of fleſh and ſpirit, and daigne them to become partakers of the body of thy onely begotten Sonne.</hi> Of Confeſſion of ſinnes at beginning of the Maſſe hath been ſaid: After the Conſecration, the Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is contained in theſe words, <hi>Pax Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni ſit ſemper vobiſcum: The Peace of God be with you alwayes.</hi> You ſhall ſee how Luther under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands it, in his form of Communion, of the yeare MDXXIII. <hi>Quae eſt quaedam quaſi pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica abſolutio à peccatis communicantium. Vox planè Evangelica, annuncians remiſsionem pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorum, unica illa ac digniſsima ad menſam Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini praeparatio, ſi fide apprehendatur, non ſecus at que ex ore Chriſti prolata: Which is,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a kind of publick abſolution of them that communicate from their ſinnes. The very voice of the Goſpel pronouncing remiſsion of ſinnes, the onely fittest preparation to the Lords Board, if apprehended by faith, as out of Chriſts mouth.</hi>
                  <pb n="386" facs="tcp:169390:199"/> But it is plain that this is to be accounted a benediction, becauſe, as hath been ſaid, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſinnes and prayer for pardon upon the ſame, is made at the beginning of the Maſſe. In the Liturgy of S. Baſil which we have tranſlated out of the Arabick, at the beginning, prayer is made for remiſſion of ſinnes at large, upon the promiſe of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, <hi>Whoſe ſinnes ye remit—</hi>the like prayer is made there after receiving the Euchariſt. In the Ethiopick, prayer is made before the Conſecration of the Euchariſt to like pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, though corrupted with that ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which ignorance breedeth. This ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth moſt anſwerable to that Confeſſion of ſinnes which our Service uſeth before the Euchariſt, otherwiſe it is to be granted, that in moſt Liturgies, that which ſeemeth to keep moſt correſpondence with it, is rather a benediction, then Confeſſion with prayer for pardon of ſinnes.</p>
               <p>It remaineth, that from that which hath been ſaid, we give account of that Form of Service which we uſe, deriving it higher then the Maſſe (from which it is charged to come, as containing nothing but that which is found there, though not all that is there) and ſhewing, where it ſhall be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, that the corruptions of the Maſſe are laid aſide in it. How juſt this charge is, may appear in the Confeſſion of ſinnes which it
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:169390:199"/> begins with: were it enough to condemne any part of our Service, to ſay, that the like is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Breviary and Maſſe, then muſt we condemne almoſt all Reformed Churches, that uſe Confeſſion of ſinnes at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their Service, as the Breviary and Maſſe doth. Du Pleſſis thought otherwiſe: like a man of Learning as well as Nobilitie, he ſaw it was an argument of ſome Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the practice of the Reformed Churches in France, that Confeſſion of ſinnes, which they uſe in the beginning, was and had been uſed in the Maſſe, and this ancient uſe an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to recommend it. And we have cauſe to ſee, that though it was not uſed in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Service, where Hearers and Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents were diſmiſſed in the middle, yet the alteration of times having brought that to nothing, we have no cauſe to balk it at the beginning, though it be there uſed in the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viary and Maſſe. He that will uſe a little judgement and conſcience, muſt diſtinguiſh between a form of Publick Service, and the corruptions of the Maſſe pinned to it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that which we follow, and the reaſons why we follow it. If by doing that which is done in the Maſſe, we retain the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it, it is time it were done no more: If any man would not have us do that aright, which tends to the Service of God, becauſe in the Maſſe it is done amiſſe, we are bidden
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:169390:200"/> to our loſſe. The reaſon why we begin with Confeſſion of ſinnes is not to be faulted; Both becauſe daily ſinnes accrue daily upon the Congregations and members of it, and daily reckonings not daily cleared oppreſſe in the end, and there is no ſuch means as the publick Prayers of the Church to ſtrike them clear: And particularly, as an entrance and preparation to the Service of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if our Confeſsion be ſuch as it muſt be preſumed to be, it is the onely ſufficient diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to make our Service acceptable to God. That which this Church of England is to give account of in particular, is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of forgiveneſſe upon the Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinnes, not uſed in other Reformed Churches. In this he ſhall proceed upon the ſureſt ground, that firſt ſhall reſolve wherein the power of binding and looſing, of retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and remitting ſinnes, given by our Lord in the Goſpel, under the Symbole of the keyes of his houſe, conſiſteth, and how farre it extendeth. For as there is no queſtion, that the Miniſters of the Church, by this Commiſsion, are authorized to DECLARE forgiveneſſe of ſinnes to whomſoever they ſhall find diſpoſed by ſerious Contrition and true Faith to receive it at Gods hands: So to think, that to bind and looſe, to remit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſinnes, is nothing elſe but to declare them bound or looſed, remitted or retained,
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:169390:200"/> and that the Charge whereof we ſpeak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in declaring this, and nothing elſe, is a thing which the property of no language will bear, ſeeing that in all uſe of ſpeech, all men underſtand it to be one thing to bind and looſe, to retain and remit ſinnes, another thing to declare that: Yet is it no part of my mind, to make this power of the keyes, by which ſinnes are bound or remitted, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the power of pronouncing ſentence of forgiveneſſe, which God ratifieth: as reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well aſſured, that God giveth pardon to whomſoever he ſees diſpoſed to receive it: And that thence forth, that diſpoſition being brought to paſſe, the Miniſtery of the keyes conſiſteth onely in declaring the pardon gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by God: It ſeemeth nevertheleſſe, that the Miniſtery of the keyes is formerly ſeen otherwiſe, that is, in procuring that diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the hearts which is requiſite to make men capable of forgiveneſſe, in bringing them to the knowledge of their ſinnes, in directing the courſe which they have to take in ſeeking their reconcilement with God. The diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Primitive Church ſeemeth to point out to us this direct meaning of our Lords promiſe, agreeable to the reſt of the Scriptures: according to the words of Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milianus Biſhop of Ceſarea Cappadocia to S. Cyprian, in the lxxv. of his Epiſtles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced elſewhere: <hi>Non quaſi à nobis delicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi>

For firſt, judgement is given with great weight, as among men aſſured of Gods ſight; and then it is the greatest prejudice of the judgement to come, if a man fail ſo, as to be confined from the Communion of prayers, &amp; Aſſemblies, and all holy Commerce.</hi> It was not the mere preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scripture, and knowledge of the doctrine of it, that brought men to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their offenſes, according to Firmilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus: Tertullian ſhews it was the Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the reproofs, the Cenſures of the Church, that were imployed to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:169390:201"/> By whom it followeth there, <hi>Praeſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent probati quique Seniores: The Preſidents are all the approved Elders.</hi> The Biſhop (whom we have ſeen him acknowledge elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where) and his Presbyters.

The Exhortations, the Reproofs, the Cenſures, by which men were brought to the ſight and acknowledgement of their faults, and conſtrained to the due courſe of humiliation for procuring forgiveneſſe, were miniſtred at their Aſſemblies, but by the Preſidents. The means of forgiveneſſe, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred in the diſcipline of Penance, conſiſts in the parties repentance, and the prayers of the Church. Penance was not preſcribed in the Ancient Church onely to give ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Church, for the ſcandall of bad example: Thoſe that imagine this, ſhall not take notice of any mention of it in Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Writers, but they ſhall find their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take convinced: It was to appeaſe the wrath of God offended, and to recover his favour again, which is in Firmilianus his terms, <hi>to</hi>
                  <pb n="392" facs="tcp:169390:202"/> 
                  <hi>make ſatisfaction to God,</hi> not in the ſenſeleſſe and impious ſenſe of the now Church of Rome, to make him recompenſe for the debt of puniſhment incurred, but according to the uſe of the word in good Latine, to appeaſe his wrath with true ſorrow and with cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all contrition, to ſeek reconcilement. Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of hands was not uſed once, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing ſentence of forgiveneſſe, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes at Publick Service, during the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript time of Penance, thoſe of that State, after the earneſt prayers of the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for their pardon, coming and kneeling afore the Biſhop, holding his hands over their heads, with his bleſſing and Prayers for that purpoſe, were diſmiſſed afore the Myſteries: this was called on their part <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or falling down, on his part <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> or Impoſition of hands in Penance. In the miniſtery of theſe means of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the power of the keyes is ſeen. In Rhenanus his Argument to Tertullians book <hi>de Poenit.</hi> are to be found divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable things to this purpoſe, out of the Penitentialls of Theodulphus of Orleans, and Theodore of Canterbury, out of S. Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil and Tertullian, that Confeſſion to God is that which cleanſeth ſinne, but Confeſſion to the Church, is to the purpoſe of learning the courſe men are to hold, in ſeeking par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and obtaining the Prayers of the
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:169390:202"/> Church to that purpoſe. Beſides this, I find that S. Cyprian hath placed the power of the keyes in the Sacrament of Baptiſme. His words are theſe, Epiſt. lxxiii. <hi>Manifeſtum est autem, ubi &amp; per quos remiſſa peccatorum dari poſsit, quae in baptiſmo ſcilicet datur. Nam Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro primùm Dominus (ſuper quem aedificavit Eccleſiam, &amp; unde unitatis originem inſtituit &amp; oſtendit) poteſtatem iſtam dedit, ut id ſolve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur in coelis, quod ille ſolviſſet in terris. Now it is manifeſt where and by whom remiſsion of ſinnes may be given, I mean that which is given in Baptiſme. For unto Peter (upon whom he built the Church, and from whom he appointed and expreſſed the originall of unitie) our Lord at firſt gave this power, that it ſhould be looſed in heaven, which he looſed on earth.</hi> And by and by afterwards: <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nde intelligimus, non niſi in Eccleſia praepoſitis, &amp; in Evangelica le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge ac dominica ordinatione fundatis, licere ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizare, &amp; remiſsam peccatorum dare. Whence we underſtand, that it is not lawfull but for thoſe that are ſet over the Church, and founded upon the law of the Goſpel, and the Ordinance of our Lord, to baptize and give remiſsion of ſinnes;</hi> to wit, as is given by the power which S. Peter received under the figure of the keyes of Gods Church. I find further, that Primaſius, a ſcholar of S. Auguſtines, ſeems to place the power of binding and looſing, in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt: <hi>in Apoc.</hi>
                  <pb n="394" facs="tcp:169390:203"/> viii. 3. A thing ſomewhat ſtrange, to make the power of binding and looſing all one with the Sacraments: But that it is to be remembred, that the judgement of the Church, and the Miniſters of it, goes before the miniſtring of them, to diſcern how fit they are for them, that pretend, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them to the means which make them capable of forgiveneſſe. It is no more then follows there in S. Cyprian, ſpeaking of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptizing thoſe that returned from their he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies: <hi>Quapropter, qui fidei &amp; veritati praeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, eos qui ad fidem &amp; veritatem veniunt, &amp; agentes poenitentiam remitti ſibi peccata poſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, decipere non debemus &amp; fallere: Sed cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectos à nobis, ac reformatos, ad regnum coelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum diſciplinis coeleſtibus erudire. Therefore we that are over the faith and truth, muſt not deceive nor cooſen thoſe that come to the faith and truth, and doing Penance, deſire their ſinnes to be remitted. But inſtruct them, amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and reformed by us, to the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, with heavenly diſcipline.</hi> They that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from-hereſies, ſought remiſſion of ſinnes by repentance: his opinion was, that it was not to be had without a ſecond Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme: and the power of binding and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing he makes to conſiſt in preſcribing repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and admitting them to baptiſme upon repentance. So that in ſumme, he ſhall ſeem moſt ſufficiently to compriſe the whole
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:169390:203"/> charge of binding and looſing, that ſhall make it to conſiſt in the miniſterie of thoſe means, which diſpoſe men to be capable of remiſſion of ſinnes. In which regard the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Church ſhall be ſaid, with as much propertie of ſpeech, to remit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſinnes, to bind and looſe, as the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian is ſaid to cure thoſe diſeaſes, in which he does no more, but preſcribe or applie the remedies. But no man doubts but this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as it is appointed in reſpect of God to procure pardon, ſo it is in reſpect of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to aſſure it: Which aſſurance, as it is warrantable for them to give, that have ſeen the courſe performed which they are intruſted to preſcribe; ſo is it due for him to receive, that hath performed it. Suppoſe then, we leave it queſtionable, as not to be diſputed in this place, what ſinnes are to come under the diſcipline of Penance, either of neceſſitie, or for a ſure courſe of procuring their pardon: Certain it is, that the children of God do continually remember, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe and bitterneſſe of ſpirit, the ſinnes which they committed of old: And certain it is, that mens daily offenſes are not capable of ſo ſolemn a cure: ſo great is the number of them, that it is not poſſible for mans mind to attend them in particular. And as certain it is, that there is no means ſo powerfull to obtain pardon of them, as the daily prayers
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:169390:204"/> of the Congregation to that purpoſe. So that the courſe which the Church preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth for the pardon of daily offenſes being put in practice, what can be more juſt, more due, then to declare that forgiveneſſe, which thoſe that diſſemble not, thoſe that are as they pretend to be, do attain? What more comfortable, then to heare the news of it from his mouth, by whom the Church mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtreth the office? What more ſeaſonable, then to do this before we come to praiſe God, and heare his word, that we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade our hearts, that he accepteth this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice at the hands of them that hate not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themſelves? In this conſideration I muſt needs preferre the Order of this Church of England, before that of other reformed Churches, in that we put Confeſſion of ſinnes in the firſt place of our Service, they referre it till after the Pſalmes, &amp; the reading of the Scriptures, when the Preacher goes up into the pulpit. They reckon them, as needs they muſt, of the ſubſtance of their Service. And Du Pleſſis hath pleaded them, as he had reaſon, to ſhew, that their Service cometh nearer that of the Primitive Church, then the Maſſe: But beginning as they do, without ſolemn Confeſſion of ſinnes before, they give the people occaſion to eſteem them otherwiſe then the Service of God, as taken up merely to while out the time while
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:169390:204"/> the people aſſemble. Whereas the ſolemn beginning of our Service, with Confeſſion of ſinnes, ſerves to put the people in mind, that it is all the ſolemn ſervice of God that follows, and of the attention of mind, and devotion of ſpirit which they ow it, by the preparation of confeſſing and putting away ſinnes, requiſite to make it acceptable. The more have they to anſwer for, that make it their employment to extinguiſh in the minds of the people that reſpect to this part of Gods Service, which the Order of the Church hath laboured to procure, and with the bleſſing of God had procured, had not their peeviſhneſſe been, that will not have God ſerved, unleſſe it be that way they like. Whatſoever honour the praiſes of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently and attentively performed might have yielded him, whatſoever good fruit the learning of his Scriptures might have brought forth in his people, is with juſtice to be required at their hands, that have been the means to intercept it, by the unjuſt diſgrace, which they have ſtuck upon the ſettled Order of this Service. Now as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Ancient and generall courſe of Gods praiſes, and reading the Scripture, it appeareth by Juſtine Martyr and Tertullian, that the Order of reading the Scripture in the Church was arbitrary in their time, as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to the condition of the times,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:169390:205"/> and occaſions of their Aſſemblies, by the guides of ſeverall Churches. The one of them ſaith, that the Scriptures are read, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>as farre as occaſion ſerves:</hi> The others words are theſe, Apologer. C. xxxix. <hi>Coimus ad literarum Divinarum commemorationem, ſi quid praeſentium temporum qualit as aut praemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere cogit aut recognoſcere. We aſſemble to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the Scriptures of God</hi> (not like thoſe that will not Aſſemble till they be read) <hi>what the condition of the preſent times inforceth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to forewarn, or to recognize.</hi> The Ordér which is accommodated to the Condition of the times, cannot be certain and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed afore. The reaſon, why a ſet Order in theſe parts of publick Service, is now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the diſpoſition of the Guides of Churches from time to time, is the ſame for which men chooſe to live by poſitive law, rather then by the will of their Rulers, though, if men were as they ſhould be, it is manifeſt that they might cut ſtraighter by the thred of Juſtice, applying right reaſon to the caſe, then ruling their proceedings by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, that was not built upon the particular. The Order might be better were it left to particular diſpoſing, but the courſes of the world inforceth to preſume, that it would be for the worſe. Beſides, in Eccleſiaſticall matters by a ſet Order we attain uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with other Churches, to help towards
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:169390:205"/> the unitie of the whole, we avoid diſputes about what is moſt fitting, which in matters of this probable nature muſt needs be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, we avoid jealouſies and umbrages up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that which is not cuſtomable. What this amounts to, S. Auguſtines experience may teach us, Serm. cxliv. de tempore. <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lueram aliquando ut per ſingulos annos ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dùm omnes Evangeliſt as etiam Paſsio legeretur: factum eſt: audierunt homines quod non conſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verunt, &amp; perturbati ſunt. I had once a deſire that every yeare the Paſsion alſo</hi> (as the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, in Eaſter-week) <hi>ſhould be read accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all the Evangeliſts: it was done: men heard what they had not wont to heare, and were troubled.</hi> How unjuſt the charge of the Maſſe upon our Service is, hath appeared in the firſt point of it: how untrue it is will appear in the next, that is, in the Order of Pſalmes and Leſſons at the daily Morning and Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Service. For, if becauſe the Breviarie and Maſſe contain a certain order of Pſalmes and Leſſons for the Service of God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all orders of Pſalmes and Leſſons to that purpoſe are derived from the Brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie and Maſſe, and chargeable with the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of them; what ſhall become of the Ancient Church before there was any ſuch thing as Breviarie or Maſſe, that is, either form of publick Service in the opinion of thoſe that profeſſe this, or, according to the
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:169390:206"/> truth, as the Maſſe importeth the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of publick Service? What ſhall become of the Church under the Apoſtles, when publick Service conſiſted of the ſame Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, as hath been ſhewed, and the Order of them is no more then S. Pauls rule, <hi>Let all things be done decently and in Order?</hi> But if the meaning of theſe clamours be to ſay, that this ſame Order of going over the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter once a moneth at daily Morning and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening Service, of going over the Bible or all the moſt convenient of it once a yeare, is the Order of the Breviarie and Maſſe, it might concern all men either of honeſtie or ſhame, though not to look into the Breviarie or Maſſe, of which they are ſo confident, yet to look upon the Preface of this our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which they condemne without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and think whether men of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe would uſe all thoſe excellent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to excuſe the alteration of that courſe, which now they are accuſed for retaining. But granting all to be true which is ſo appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently falſe, were the Maſſe worſe then it is; and all this the very Order contained in it, is it poſſible that any man of judgement or conſcience, ſhould think it enough to ſay, that this or that is in the Breviarie or Maſſe, and never trouble himſelf to ſhew that it is part of the corruptions which they contain? What reaſon is there to prove, that the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:169390:206"/> of the Pſalter once a moneth, is not for the Service of God, and the edification of his Church? This Church aboliſheth not the uſe of Pſalmes to muſicall tunes, where they may have place in the courſe of our Service. Is it demanded further, that the monethly courſe of the Pſalter be aboliſhed, to make them room? If it be, the Church is bidden to loſſe, and the ſervice of God ſhall ſuffer in it: the people is now more plentifully conducted to the knowledge of God, and his praiſes according to his own word: then, the ruder ſort ſhall have much ado, to dream over a Pſalme, in a great deal of time, in a manner ſo farre from that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie to which it pretendeth, as may be a juſt means to dead the devotion of ſuch as are not ſet upon a good edge. The Anſwers of the people repreſent, in ſome ſort, that moſt ancient and commendable faſhion of Antiphones, and teach them their office, and conduct them to bear their part in the praiſes of God, not to ſit by as Hearers, where they are to be Actours. And where that faſhion may be repreſented to the truth, in the more skilfull Congregations of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiate and Cathedrall Churches, what a ſtrange prejudice is it, that will not ſuffer reaſonable perſons, to reliſh the advantage of it, in the ſervice of God? But all this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords no ground to condemne the courſe of
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:169390:207"/> thoſe more skilfull Congregations of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiate and Cathedrall Churches, in ſinging the Hymnes with Muſick, provided the Congregation may underſtand and go along in their devotions. He that undertakes to do it, ſhall be ſure to run upon a rock from which he ſhall not come off without ſplit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that is, the preſident of the publick Service of God in the Temple. For let no man think that this is to be ranked with the figurative Service of God, according to the Ceremoniall law: That he muſt leave to the inner Court of Prieſts, the praiſes of God are part of the perpetuall Service of God in ſpirit and truth, to laſt under the Goſpel, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted and indicted by the Prophets, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of that ſervice, frequented by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and a preſident for the Church, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule of edification of it. I am aſhamed to repeat here the needleſſe quarrels with the old Tranſlation of the Pſalmes in uſe. Men ſeem now to be wiſe enough, to ſee the ſhameleſſe partialitie which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, in that men ſhould be ſo quick, as to ſee ſo many faults in that, and paſſe by all the extreme barbariſmes, the ſpurious additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the falſe tranſlations which the Pſalmes in Meetre contain. I ſuppoſe the Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends not to averre, all that is read in the Church, to be truly tranſlated. If ſo, God help the univerſall Church, when it had no
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:169390:207"/> Scripture of the old Teſtament, but the Greek, and the Tranſlations of it. Let them that find fault, imploy themſelves, and all they can make, to tranſlate but that one book of Pſalmes; if they put their work paſt a conſiderable number of juſt exceptions, I am ready to forfeit for one. It is ſufficient to my underſtanding, and alwayes was, that what is read in the Church is more fit for the edification of it, then to go about to change it. And what intereſſe hath any man not to deſire change in that point, but S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtines experience alledged afore, <hi>audierunt homines quod non conſueverunt, &amp; perturbati ſunt?</hi> What will any man ſay now to the Order of reading the Scriptures once a yeare in the Church? Shall this be the thanks of the Church of England, for renewing that religious Order of the Ancient Church, and providing a publick courſe for the people to become acquainted with the Scripture, to ſay, that it is out of the Breviarie or Maſſe? The offenſe is, becauſe ſome of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha are read: before that offenſe had been taken, it ſhould have been ſhewed, that nothing but that which is inſpired by the H. Ghoſt ſhould be heard in the Church. What then would a number of good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons become, which how good ſoever, no man dare ſay are inſpired. Sure, they that will adviſe with reaſon and conſcience, not with
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:169390:208"/> prejudice, muſt enquire, whether the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them promote or hinder the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church. In that reſpect, ſo farre is it from me to put out ſome Apocrypha, that I would rather put in the firſt of Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabees, as deſcribing the fulfilling of ſome of Daniels propheſies, and the then ſtate of Gods people. But is it from the Maſſe that the Church of England learned to reſtore the Sermon into the due place at ſolemn Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice? I ſhould have thought it one of the abuſes of the Maſſe, that whereas, by the univerſall cuſtome of the Church, the place of it appeared, there the uſe of it was for the moſt part ſilenced. The good Order of this Church, and the ſucceſſe God hath lent it, hath prevailed ſo farre, that this Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Order may be ſaid to have recovered the ancient place and rank. As for the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon Sermon, I am yet to learn what place it had in the publick Service of the Church, by what Command of Scripture, what rule or cuſtome of the Ancient Church it is preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Timothie is commanded to be inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, but to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? to publiſh the Word, to do the office of an Evangeliſt, to winne ſtrangers to the Faith. How can that be importune? So Paul preached at Troas till midnight. If that be our preſident, let us celebrate the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, as thoſe of the Church of Rome do,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:169390:208"/> on Chriſtmaſſe eve. There are examples of preaching as well Evening as Morning in the ancient Church, but at particular times, and on particular occaſions: my queſtion is, to ſhew me the place of the Sermon in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon Service, as it hath been ſhewed in the Morning Service, otherwiſe not ſatisfied of any rule or cuſtome of the Church. Not becauſe mens laws are not a fenſe to Gods law, and that it is not for the good of the Church the more it is frequented, as it ought, eſpecially, to the purpoſe that the people may ſufficiently underſtand their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and the grounds of it: but becauſe it is reaſon, that the offices of the Church be practiſed with reſpect to opportunities and abilities, not in ſuch ſort, as may neither advance the Honour of God, nor of the Profeſſion which we make. We heare no news of new reaſons againſt the Creed, for part of the Service. It was a great work to ſettle ſuch forms as might conclude, and confine, and bring to light the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of Hereticks. The next work to that was to bring it into the Service. So was it beſt commended to the knowledge, to the reſpect of Gods people; which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect had it been preſerved, this new varniſh of old Hereſies, which prevaileth ſo farre abroad, is not like to have taken with the people. What ſhall I ſay of the Collects or
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:169390:209"/> Prayers which the daily Service concludes with? My Propoſition allows me not to diſpute the particular conceptions, or terms in which they are expreſſed. But I muſt commend the Order of anſwers of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in all places of the Service where it ſtands. It refreſhes their attention; it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them their part at Publick Prayers, not to ſtand by and cenſure how well the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter playes the mouth of the Congregation. If they be to act their part in it, the part aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned them in our Service conducts them in doing their office. As for the ſubject of them, the occaſions of ſeverall ſeaſons and ſolemnities, protection againſt bodily and ghoſtly enemies, conduct of Gods grace and providence, ſucceſſe of the rule of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and guidance of the Church, and the like; it is unknown to me, that any thing is more fit and requiſite then theſe to be remembred at all publick Aſſemblies. It hath been ſhewed, that thoſe prayers for all ſtates and conditions of perſons in the Church, which ſince have been called Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanies, were from the beginning frequented at the ſolemn Service of the Church, before the celebration of the Euchariſt, and that it is like ſo to have been, even under the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. Now though the condition of the Church be not for the preſent capable of ſo good and ſo excellent a cuſtome, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:169390:209"/> Celebration of the Euchariſt on Lords-dayes, yet was there great reaſon that the Litanies ſhould be preſcribed on theſe dayes nevertheleſſe, as the next member of the Publick Service of God, obſerved from the beginning of the Church. And becauſe they contain matter of Supplication, for the diverting of Gods judgements, and obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his bleſsings, nothing could be more ſutable, then to adde them to the daily Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Service on Wedneſdayes and Fridayes, as the exerciſe of that continuall humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before God, to which the obſervation of theſe dayes was intended, to the unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able benefit of the Church, and the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all diſcharge of thoſe moſt excellent offices of Faſting, Prayer, &amp; Alms among Chriſtians. It is paſt mine apprehenſion to imagine, wherein any man will pretend to fault the act of Confeſsion of ſinnes in the Publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, before celebrating and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Euchariſt. For if Repentance be a diſpoſition requiſite to make men capable of the grace which it exhibiteth, ſhall it not be exerciſed at the Publick Service of God, which our common profeſsion acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth ſo neceſſary, rather then onely preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be performed in particular? And if it prove by the verdict of all conſciences, to be darkned from time to time by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of daily offenſes, joyned with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſſe,
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:169390:210"/> and unfruitfulneſſe, is not that Order for the edification of the Church, which reviveth, and refreſheth, and inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eneth it, at ſo ſolemn an act of religious Service as this? Sure I am, that whoſoever will lay his hand upon an honeſt heart, ſhall not ſay, that the form which we uſe is taken out of the Maſſe, when he conſidereth, that which the Reformation teacheth and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth of free pardon of ſinnes through Chriſt, to be ſo comfortably expreſſed in it. And ſeeing it hath been ſhewed afore, that in the practice of the Ancient Church, to them which for notorious or acknowledged offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were under the ſtate of Penance, the means of forgiveneſſe was partly miniſtred in the publick Prayers of the Church and the Miniſters of it, what can be more ſutable to this practice, and the grounds of it, on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of thoſe that acknowledge themſelves ſinners, but are not reduced by the Church under that diſcipline, then that prayer or bleſſing wherein he that celebrateth the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, imploreth that Grace on their behalf at Gods hands? To me it ſeemeth, that the rehearſall of the Decalogue in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that which ſome ſtill call the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Service, together with the anſwers of the people, craving pardon and grace to obſerve them for the future, is to the very purpoſe of this Confeſsion of ſinnes,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:169390:210"/> and to actuate our repentance, by calling to mind our offenſes by retail, though it is in the Order of our Service ſomewhat removed from it, as being thought fit, for other reaſons, to be uſed when the Euchariſt was not celebrated. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, were it left to my choice, I confeſſe I ſhould think the moſt proper place for this Confeſsion of ſinnes, to be that which it holdeth in the firſt Edition of Edward VI. after the conſecration of the elements, and before receiving them, with that prayer which beginneth, <hi>We do not preſume—</hi>after the ſame: For the reaſon why it hath been otherwiſe ordered, ſeemeth to have been to avoid offenſe, leſt it might be thought to import Tranſubſtantiation, in thoſe words ſpoken after Conſecration, <hi>So to eat the fleſh of thy dear Sonne Jeſus Chriſt, and to drink his bloud:</hi> The cauſe of which offenſe, if any ſuch may be imagined, ſeemeth to me utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly voided, in the words added there, <hi>ſo to eat the fleſh of thy dear Sonne Jeſus Chriſt, and to drink his bloud</hi> IN THESE HOLY MYSTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIES. Thus much let me be bold to affirm, that it would be a great fault in the Church to celebrate this Sacrament, without ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing anſwerable to that Thanksgiving, wherewith it was firſt inſtituted by our Lord, and practiſed by the whole Church. Suppoſe it contain no mention of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:169390:211"/> and the bleſsing of Gods creatures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as hath been ſaid, it ſeemeth to have been practiſed heretofore, in relation to mans bodily ſuſtenance, wherewith it was inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; practiſed at the firſt: Without Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving for the redemption of the world, it is not duly received; therefore with it, it is duly celebrated. Of this Thanksgiving for the redemption of the world, there is due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance in the very end of the Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from thoſe words, <hi>And above all things—</hi>therefore it ſeemeth, that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, wherein that Thanksgiving is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and expreſſed, after, <hi>Lift up your hearts,</hi> had followed very ſeaſonably, after remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the cauſe and ground of it. But the ſubſtance of that which is done, is alwayes the ſame. Further, how little ſoever the grace of Gods goodneſſe depend on that which by man is ordered for the fitteſt, and though it is not pretended that any Law of God in the Scriptures inacteth this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be celebrated with that Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving from which it is called the Euchariſt, or that Prayer for the effect of Chriſts Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the preſent, which is the cloſe of it: yet ſince it hath been ſhewed that ſo this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament hath been celebrated from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Church, and that for ſo good reaſons upon our Lords example at the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of it, and ſince this courſe ſo much
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:169390:211"/> concerns the edification of the Church, it ſeemeth altogether requiſite, that the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be not ſuppoſed deputed for ſuch a bleſsing to the Congregation, by the mere act of receiving them to ſuch purpoſe, but ſhould be actually and formally deputed, by remembring the Inſtitution of our Lord, and by the prayer of the Church, profeſsing the execution, and begging the bleſsing of the ſame, which I ſuppoſe is called Conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among us. Gregory the great and Iſidore tell us, that the Apoſtles, and S. Peter by name, celebrated the Euchariſt with the Lords Prayer alone; but that <hi>alone,</hi> muſt be underſtood to except other acceſſories to the manner of celebrating, conſiſting in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt or Thanksgiving, whereof the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Conſecration was the foot and cloſe. Rabanus de Inſtit. Cler. lib. 32. <hi>Cum bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictione enim &amp; gratiarum actione primùm Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus corporis &amp; ſanguinis ſui Sacramenta de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicavit, &amp; Apostolis tradidit, quod exinde Apoſtoli imitati fecere, &amp; ſucceſſores ſuos fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere docuerunt, quod &amp; nunc, per totum Orbem terrarum, generaliter tota cuſtodit Eccleſia: For our Lord at firſt initiated, and delivered to his Apoſtles the myſteries of his body and bloud, with bleſsing and Thanksgiving, which thence the Apoſtles imitated, and did, and taught their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours to do, and which now the whole Church generally obſerveth all the world over.</hi> That
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:169390:212"/> which hath been ſaid is enough to ſhow, that it was alwayes celebrated with this Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, the foot whereof, as hath been ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was the Prayer of the Church for the effect of the Inſtitution of our Lord at the preſent. Where are they now that take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to ſay, that all our Service is taken out of the Maſſe? how will they diſcharge themſelves in this moſt eminent point? or how will they be able to digeſt this untruth, which the leaſt inſight of the Maſſe will thruſt down their throat? the form of the Maſſe was related afore, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t nobis Corpus &amp; Sanguis fiat dilectiſsimi filii tui Domini noſtri Jeſu Christi,</hi> and it was ſhewed, that Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation is not contained in theſe words: Nevertheleſſe becauſe there might be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe taken at the words, upon the ſenſe of thoſe that uſe them, we ſee them altered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe terms, wherein the truth of that which is done is moſt excellently expreſſed, to the intent of the Scripture, and true ſenſe of the Primitive Church, in theſe words, <hi>Heare us, O mercifull Father;</hi> and thoſe which follow. In like ſort, becauſe the very term of Offering, and Sacrifice, though uſed with a farre other meaning then the Church of Rome profeſſeth, ſeemeth to ſound their meaning, it is not onely removed out of the Prayer for the whole ſtate of Chriſts Church, but the prayer it ſelf removed, to
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:169390:212"/> ſtand afore the Conſecration, as we conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured it did ſtand in the Africane Churches, and not after it, to give opinion that Chriſt, preſent by Conſecration, was ſacrificed then for the quick and dead, as the Church of Rome imagineth. Of the reſt of the Service of the Euchariſt I ſhall need to ſay nothing, having ſhewed, that in the ancient Church, as with us, the time of communicating was transacted with Pſalmes, after that Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, the diſmiſsion upon that. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is diſmiſſed with the bleſsing in our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as in the moſt ancient form related in the Conſtitutions of the Apoſtles; and ſo in the Reformed Churches of France, though they uſe that of Moſes, ſtill frequented by the Synagogue. In the Service preſcribed for Lords dayes, and Feſtivalls, when the Euchariſt is not celebrated, it is not ſtrange if ſomething be added above the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary courſe to make it more ſolemn, though it had been rather to be wiſhed, that the world were diſpoſed for the true ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of it. Is the voice of the Law, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us to mind our offenſes, and moving to crave pardon and grace for the future, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the Service of God? The Leſſons of the Epiſtles and Goſpels belong indeed to the firſt part of the Service, as hath been ſhewed; but ſhall we take them to come from the Maſſe, where they are laſt found, or from
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:169390:213"/> S. Hierome, from whom they ſeem firſt to have come? And was it not convenient in them to remember what the Church cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brateth at ſeverall ſeaſons, and ſolemnities of the yeare? and to promote the edification of the Church, and inſtruction of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the myſteries of the faith, by giving Preachers a ſubject of their Sermons, ſutable to thoſe ſolemnities. Laſt of all, though the world is not diſpoſed, to the continuall cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Euchariſt, yet was it requiſite in reverence to the Apoſtles Order, and the univerſall practice of the Church, that the prayer for all ſtates of the ſame, ſhould be uſed at almoſt all ſolemn Aſſemblies, which becauſe it alwayes went along with the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, as it is uſed, ſerves to put us in mind, what is wanting. In fine, though all Forms of Service deviſed by men muſt needs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main diſputable, and happy it is, when ſo they are, but upon ſlight matters, ſo my hope is, that from hence will appear, that the form which we uſe deſerves this commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it is poſsible to alter it for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but eaſie to alter it for the worſe. Thus farre upon the Principles propounded in the beginning, of things remembred in the Scripture, concerning the publick Service of God, and the moſt ancient and generall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Church to expound them. I have diſcourſed the ſubſtance and form of Gods
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:169390:213"/> Publick Service at ſolemn Aſſemblies for that purpoſe, the circumſtances of it, and the particular form which we uſe. Of the reſt of Eccleſiaſticall Offices, and the Courſe we uſe in them, it was not my purpoſe to ſay any thing at the preſent: In which nevertheleſſe the reaſons hitherto diſputed will eaſily take place to ſhow, both that it is for the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, that the performance of them be ſolemn and by preſcript form, and that the form which we uſe is exceeding commendable.</p>

               <p>ANd now without further diſpute it is to be ſeen, what is preſcribed concerning the Publick Service of God in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and what is left to be ordered by humane appointment. The particular Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces whereof it conſiſteth, of Publick Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the Praiſes of God, of reading and expounding the Scriptures, of the Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Euchariſt, and the reſt, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed and recommended to the Church in
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:169390:214"/> the rules and practice of holy Scripture. The Order and Form in which they are to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, is acknowledged on all hands that it ought to be preſcript, yet is it no where preſcribed in the Scriptures, but left to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Ordinance: That which is to be Preached is acknowledged, on all hands, to be referred for the moſt part to the private endeavours of particular perſons: not in reſpect to any immediate inſpiration of the holy Ghoſt, otherwiſe to be quenched, but becauſe it is the ordinary means to inſtruct and admoniſh whole Congregations, in that which moſt concerneth them of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and doctrine of the Scriptures. Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayers, ſome think are to be miniſtred according to the diſpoſition and diſcretion of particular guides of particular Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by virtue of the Apoſtles Ordinance, forbidding to Quench the ſpirit. Here it is proved, that, becauſe it is confeſſed, that the Grace of praying by immediate inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not now extant, therefore the purpoſe of this Ordinance ceaſeth, and that the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary rule of the edification of the Church to be attained by the Order and Comlineſſe of theſe things which are done at publick Aſſemblies, is followed to farre more pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, in the uſe of a form preſcript and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. It is further here to be obſerved, that whatſoever may concern the honour of
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:169390:214"/> God, the unity of the Church, the truth of Religion, and the recommendation of it, is moſt effectually to be procured, as procured it was from the beginning of our Faith, by the dependance of Churches, viſibly deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the appointment and ordinance of the Apoſtles. It hath been declared, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that which was done by Barnabas and Paul, ordaining Presbyters through the Churches, Acts xiv. 22. according to that which Titus is inſtructed to ordain Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters through the Cities, Titus 1, 3. that is, Colledges of Presbyters to order the Churches founded in populous Cities, ſo throughout the whole Chriſtian world, were all Churches of Cities, thought meet for their greatneſſe, whether inſtituted by the Apoſtles, or propagated thence, governed by Presbyteries, or Colledges of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the Heads whereof were Biſhops, in Succeſſion to the Apoſtles. We know the Goſpel attained to the Countreys and Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories lying under theſe Cities, upon the preaching of the Apoſtles; the Scripture ſaith, Acts xiii. 49. upon the firſt preaching of Paul and Barnabas, <hi>The word of the Lord was diſperſed all over the Countrey:</hi> and Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens, diſciple of the Apoſtles, Epiſt. ad Cor. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <pb n="418" facs="tcp:169390:215"/> 
                  <hi>Cities and Countreys they made the first-fruits of them, trying them by the ſpirit, Biſhops and Deacons of ſuch as ſhould believe,</hi> ſpeaking of the Apoſtles and their time: And we are ready to believe, that Congregations might be planted in theſe Countreys and Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries during their time, though we reade no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it here, and the diviſion of titles and Churches, that is, City and rurall Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, in the Church of Rome, is aſſigned in the Popes lives to a farre later time then this. But do we not know that according to the generall and Primitive Cuſtome of the Church, theſe rurall Congregations recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their Miniſters from the Mother-Churches in which their Ordinations were made? Doth it not appear to common ſenſe, that the form of Gods publick Service, as it hath been deſcribed, uniform in the main in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients from the beginning, unconforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in particulars of leſſe moment, was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by particular congregations according to their Mother-Churches? Doth not the diſtinction of Dioceſes, or as they were firſt called, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, habitations adjoyning to chief Cities, received in all parts of the Church, proclaim that the inſtitution and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, cannot have been acceſſory and particular, but univerſall and Primitive? And what cauſe have we to doubt that the holy Ghoſt directing the Apoſtles, ſhould move
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:169390:215"/> them to that Courſe, which according to the condition of the world, muſt needs be moſt reaſonable? Or who can doubt that according to the condition of the world, it is moſt reaſonable to preſume, that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and populous reſidences muſt needs be furniſhed of men of beſt abilities, and means to know the right courſe of ordering publick matters of the Church, for moſt advantage to the truth of Religion, the Peace of the Church, and the Service of God, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then that vulgar and rude Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, inflamed with the ignorance and malice and overweening of unable guides, ſhould chooſe for themſelves, not onely in things neceſſary for their own ſouls health, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all have their due intereſſe, but in things concerning the generall ſtate of the Church, which they are neither bound nor able to underſtand? I muſt confeſſe to have written heretofore, that in the time of the Apoſtles, the work of Preaching ſeemeth to have gone rather by mens abilities then their Offices: And now I hope, in good time, having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared here ſeverall regards in which this is verified. It hath been ſhewed that of the the ſame Eccleſiaſticall Order, the ſame Bench of the Church, ſome Presbyters ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed the abilities of Preaching, ſome not. It hath been ſhewed, that the rank of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets furniſhed by the immediate inſpiration
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:169390:216"/> of God, for the more plentifull performance of that work in the beginning of the Goſpel, cannot be thought to have been the ſame with that of Presbyters. And if any man ſtand upon it, it ſhall not trouble me to yield that which Grotius of late hath obſerved, and under the Church of Rome Ferarius <hi>de Ritu Concionum, ii.</hi> 6. That in the Primitive times of the Church, Lay men were licenſed to preach by the Biſhops of Churches, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the inſtances alledged in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Biſhops of Paleſtine to Demetrius of Alexandria, in Origens caſe, related by Euſebius. For it ſeemeth moſt agreeable to the Succeſſion of Scribes after the Prophets in the Synagogue, ſeeing it is neither reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to conceive, that Scribes were denied this Office, when they were found fit, nor that thoſe to whom it was granted, were all Elders of Synagogues. And by this an eaſie reaſon is given how our Lord and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles are admitted to ſpeak in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, as licenſed and invited by the Elders and Rulers of them according to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, Acts xiii. 14. And perhaps the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome might remain in the Church, after propheticall Graces for the inſtruction of it were ceaſed, that thoſe which had the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Scriptures without inſpiration, ſhould be admitted to ſpeak to the people. But what is all this to theſe mechanick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:169390:216"/> that make themſelves Churches, and the Churches them their Miniſters, without education, without calling, without acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of one Church of God? They pleaſe themſelves in obſerving, that S. Paul uſed his trade while he Preached the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, as they do: And in that perhaps there is as much miſtake as in the reſt. For it is not all one for a Preacher to be bred to a trade from his youth, and for him that is bred to a trade from his youth to become a Preacher when he pleaſe. To me there is ſo much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that I yield the one to be S. Pauls caſe, as the world ſees the other to be theirs. It is obſerved in Scaligers Elenchus and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, that S. Paul in that particular made uſe of his education under Gamaliel, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it was the cuſtome of their Doctours, to breed their Scholars to a trade, as well as to the knowledge of the Law, which they were to profeſſe. And there is a ſaying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them in Pirke Aboth, of this tenour to my remembrance, Alwayes with the Law let a man learn the way of the earth; the meaning is, a trade for his maintenance. Hereupon, it is ordinary for their Rabbies to be ſirnamed by their trade. And in Maimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni Talmud Torah C. iii. you have divers ſayings of their ancient Doctours, that with the Law a man is to practiſe a trade for his maintenance, as this, <hi>All Law</hi> (that is, all
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:169390:217"/> learning of the law) <hi>with which there is not work, in the end comes to nothing, and draws on naughtineſſe, and the end of ſuch a man is, he falls to robbe creatures.</hi> And in C. ii. afore, He that exerciſes a trade with the ſtudie of the law, muſt ſpend three houres of the day at his trade, and nine at his ſtudy, which are divided as it follows there. The knowledge then of theſe abilities, to which this educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion tended, taken according to publick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of that time, and the exerciſe of them for the publick inſtruction of the people, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed according to the ſame, ſeem to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſufficient warrant of humane calling, to ſpeak to the people in the Church, in them that were not Miniſters of it. S. Ambroſe in Eph. iiii. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t ergò creſceret plebs &amp; multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicaretur, omnibus inter initia conceſſum eſt &amp; evangelizare, &amp; baptizare, &amp; Scripturas in Eccleſia explanare. That the people of believers might increaſe and multiply, in the beginning it was granted to all to preach the Goſpel, and to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize, and to expound the Scriptures in the Church.</hi> There is a difference between that which he calleth preaching the Goſpel, and expounding the Scriptures in the Church, though both are called <hi>preaching</hi> among us: For it is one thing to publiſh the Goſpel where there is no Church, another to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the doctrine of the Scriptures where there is. The Scripture witneſſeth, that thoſe
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:169390:217"/> which were diſperſed upon the perſecution raiſed about Stephen, did the one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out difference, Acts viii. 4. xi. 19. It is no more then all Chriſtians muſt do, ſo farre as they hold themſelves able to advance the faith. As for expounding the Scriptures in Churches ſettled, where Order took place, in that alſo S. Ambroſe his words may be verified, that it was granted to all, that is, to all conditions, whether Miniſters of Churches or not: But no otherwiſe granted then hath been ſaid, upon knowledge of competent abilities, according to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of publick Order, derived, as it ſeems, into the Church from the Synagogue. But doth this fault the publick Order of this time, that confineth the publick exerciſe of this Office, to the publick miniſteries of the Church? The courſe of education being open to all, and the performance of that courſe, proved and preſumed according to publick Order, of all that pretend to theſe miniſteries, the miniſteries of Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being furniſhed by that publick Order, to authorize others in Congregations ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, would be to choke the edification of the Church, by ſetting up perpetuall emulation and difference. But how eminent ſoever mens abilities are, how well ſoever known to themſelves or the world, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the inſtructions of the people with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:169390:218"/> publick Order in publick Aſſemblies, is a thing that no Scripture, no time, no Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the Primitive Church will allow. To tread all that learning under foot, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the knowledge of the Scriptures is not to be had upon humane endeavours, to undervalue the abilities of a learned age, in compariſon of the boldneſſe of mechanick perſons, in ſpending the mouth without ſenſe underneath, ſeemeth to be the wantonneſſe of this time, for after-ages to admire. But for private perſons, againſt publick Order, and the unitie of the Church, to call ſuch Aſſemblies, and to exerciſe theſe pretended abilities in ſuch Aſſemblies as publick Order forbiddeth, is neither more nor leſſe then Schiſme, let them that do it adviſe, at whoſe doore the ſinne of that Schiſme lieth. For, the publick profeſſion of this Church is the ſame, that hath been proved, theſe ſo many years, to contain no cauſe of ſeparation in it: And theſe that ſeparate are ſo farre from ſetting a foot new, or from proving old char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that they ſeem to be yet to learn, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any ſuch thing as proving that which they ſay, or not. The unitie of the Church is a thing commanded by God, the diviſions that and ſhall ariſe in the Church, are a thing foretold by God: He that hath foretold that diviſions ſhall come, hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that they ſhall not come: To me it
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:169390:218"/> ſeems a ſtrange reaſon, becauſe God hath foretold that Hereſies ſhall come in, for men therefore to ſet open the doore, and for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Order to take a courſe, by the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Churches, to allow as many reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions as Conventicles. The dependance of particular Congregations upon Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Churches, for the Originall relateth to the inſtitution of the Apoſtles, for the end, to the unitie of the Church: The dependance of theſe Biſhops Churches up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſeats of Metropolitanes and Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, acknowledgeth a mere humane Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall from the ſtate of the Romane Empire, and the reſidence of the chief Powers of it, but not without reſpect to the Goſpel firſt planted, according to the preſident of the Apoſtles, in the moſt eminent cities, and thence derived into the Countreys about: But relateth to the ſame end of one Church, as procuring the actuall correſpondence of all the members of it. Since Religion is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come part of the State of ſeveral Kingdomes and Common-wealths, they are not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from one another the laws that inforce the exerciſe of it; but it is requiſite that the exerciſe of it through each Kingdome and Common-wealth be uniform, by Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall rules, adviſed by each Church, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced by each Kingdome and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, the dependance of particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:169390:219"/> upon Epiſcopall Churches, in the exerciſe of Religion according to ſuch Rules continuing inviolable, as the inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Apoſtles. Now regard we the truth of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, regard we the peace of the Church, regard we the honour and glory of God, and the credit of our Profeſſion towards ſuch as are without, this dependance of Churches is not more effectuall in any point of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then in the uniform and preſcript form of Gods Publick Service. What means is there ſo effectuall to convey and ſettle the truth profeſſed in the minds of all people, then to glorifie God in it, and according to it, in the continuall exerciſe of his ſervice? What means ſo powerfull to obtain the peace of the Church from God, to preſerve it with men, as to joyn in the ſame uniform ſervice of God for the purpoſe? As for the honour of God, and the commendation of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion which we make, let common reaſon not poſſeſſed with prejudice be judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the voluntary extemporary conceptions of particular Miniſters of Congregations, or the forms maturely adviſed by the moſt able, ſhall prove the more probable means to procure it. Let the publick exerciſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion conſiſt, in ſpeaking to the people more then men have learned of the knowledge of the Scriptures, in permitting men to vent their own paſſions, or perhaps factions, for
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:169390:219"/> the devotions of their people, for their Prayers and Thanksgivings to God: Let the Preachers Office conſiſt in ſpeaking by meaſure of time, not by weight of matter; let it conſiſt rather in the exerciſe of the lungs, then of any knowledge in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures: Let the Hearers Office conſiſt in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of ſitting ſtill ſo many glaſſes, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in cenſuring the Preachers abilities, in Praying as well as in Preaching (for to that the office of praying in the Church may come:) And thoſe that are affected to the Profeſſion with the beſt, ſhall be forced for love of truth, to lament that it is ſo much ſcandalized &amp; hindred by them that pretend to advance it. But let the Praiſes of God, the hearing of his Scriptures read and expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Common Prayers of the Church and the celebration of the Euchariſt be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that diſcretion for the Order, with that choiſe for the ſubſtance, with that reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for the outward viſage and faſhion of what is ſaid and done reſpectively at each of theſe parts of Gods Publick Service, and let not me doubt that God the Authour, and men ſtrangers to our profeſſion, ſhall joyn in making good and acknowledging that of the Apoſtle, 1. Cor. xiiii. 25, that God is among us of a truth.</p>

So farre it concerns par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to know the Gods, without ambiguitie or doubt of the virtue and name of each; that when they are called upon by the rites and names of others, both they have their ears ſtopped, and hold us inſnared with inexpiable ſacriledges.</hi> See there afore. So Tertullian according to this ſenſe makes a very pertinent oppoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Heathen that prayed as they were prompted, and the Heathen that prayed by heart.</p>
